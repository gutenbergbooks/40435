    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
    <p>The present work is intended as a sequel and supplement to my
      History of Greece. It describes a portion of Hellenic philosophy:
      it dwells upon eminent individuals, enquiring, theorising,
      reasoning, confuting, &amp;c., as contrasted with those collective
      political and social manifestations which form the matter of
      history, and which the modern writer gathers from Herodotus,
      Thucydides, and Xenophon. </p>
    <p>Both Sokrates and Plato, indeed, are interesting characters in
      history as well as in philosophy. Under the former aspect, they
      were described by me in my former work as copiously as its general
      purpose would allow. But it is impossible to do justice to either
      of them &#8212; above all, to Plato, with his extreme variety and
      abundance &#8212; except in a book of which philosophy is the principal
      subject, and history only the accessory. </p>
    <p>The names of Plato and Aristotle tower above all others in
      Grecian philosophy. Many compositions from both have been
      preserved, though only a small proportion of the total number left
      by Aristotle. Such preservation must be accounted highly
      fortunate, when we read in Diogenes Laertius and others, the long
      list of works on various topics of philosophy, now irrecoverably
      lost, and known by little except their titles. Respecting a few of
      them, indeed, we obtain some partial indications from fragmentary
      extracts and comments of later critics. But none of these once
      celebrated philosophers, except Plato and Aristotle, can be fairly
      appreciated upon evidence furnished by themselves. The Platonic
      dialogues, besides the extraordinary genius which <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1pagevi" id="v1pagevi"></a>vi</span>they



      display as compositions, bear thus an increased price (like the
      Sibylline books) as the scanty remnants of a lost philosophical
      literature, once immense and diversified. </p>
    <p>Under these two points of view, I trust that the copious analysis
      and commentary bestowed upon them in the present work will not be
      considered as unnecessarily lengthened. I maintain, full and
      undiminished, the catalogue of Plato&#8217;s works as it was inherited
      from antiquity and recognised by all critics before the
      commencement of the present century. Yet since several subsequent
      critics have contested the canon, and set aside as spurious many
      of the dialogues contained in it, &#8212; I have devoted a <a
        href="#Platovol1ch7">chapter</a> to this question, and to the
      vindication of the views on which I have proceeded. </p>
    <p>The title of these volumes will sufficiently indicate that I
      intend to describe, as far as evidence permits, the condition of
      Hellenic philosophy at Athens during the half century immediately
      following the death of Sokrates in 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      My first two chapters do indeed furnish a brief sketch of
      Pre-Sokratic philosophy: but I profess to take my departure from
      Sokrates himself, and these chapters are inserted mainly in order
      that the theories by which he found himself surrounded may not be
      altogether unknown. Both here, and in the sixty-ninth chapter of
      my History, I have done my best to throw light on the impressive
      and eccentric personality of Sokrates: a character original and
      unique, to whose peculiar mode of working on other minds I
      scarcely know a parallel in history. He was the generator,
      indirectly and through others, of a new and abundant crop of
      compositions &#8212; the &#8220;Sokratic dialogues&#8221;: composed by many
      different authors, among whom Plato stands out as unquestionable
      coryph&aelig;us, yet amidst other names well deserving respectful
      mention as seconds, companions, or opponents.</p>
    <p>It is these Sokratic dialogues, and the various companions of
      Sokrates from whom they proceeded, that the present work is
      intended to exhibit. They form the dramatic manifestation <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1pagevii" id="v1pagevii"></a>vii</span>
      of Hellenic philosophy &#8212; as contrasted with the formal and
      systematising, afterwards prominent in Aristotle. </p>
    <p>But the dialogue is a process containing commonly a large
      intermixture, often a preponderance, of the negative vein: which
      was more abundant and powerful in Sokrates than in any one. In
      discussing the Platonic dialogues, I have brought this negative
      vein into the foreground. It reposes upon a view of the function
      and value of philosophy which is less dwelt upon than it ought to
      be, and for which I here briefly prepare the reader.</p>
    <p>Philosophy is, or aims at becoming, reasoned truth: an aggregate
      of matters believed or disbelieved after conscious process of
      examination gone through by the mind, and capable of being
      explained to others: the beliefs being either primary, knowingly
      assumed as self-evident &#8212; or conclusions resting upon them, after
      comparison of all relevant reasons favourable and unfavourable.
      &#8220;Philosophia&#8221; (in the words of Cicero), &#8220;ex rationum collatione
      consistit.&#8221; This is not the form in which beliefs or disbeliefs
      exist with ordinary minds: there has been no conscious examination
      &#8212; there is no capacity of explaining to others &#8212; there is no
      distinct setting out of primary truths assumed &#8212; nor have any
      pains been taken to look out for the relevant reasons on both
      sides, and weigh them impartially. Yet the beliefs nevertheless
      exist as established facts generated by traditional or other
      authority. They are sincere and often earnest, governing men&#8217;s
      declarations and conduct. They represent a cause in which sentence
      has been pronounced, or a rule made absolute, without having
      previously heard the pleadings.<a name="FnAnchorv1_P_1"
        href="#Footnotev1_P_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_P_1"
            id="Footnotev1_P_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv1_P_1">1</a></span>
        Napol&eacute;on, qui de temps en temps, au milieu de sa fortune
        et de sa puissance, songeait &agrave; Robespierre et &agrave; sa
        triste fin &#8212; interrogeait un jour son archi-chancelier
        Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s sur le neuf Thermidor. &#8220;<i>C&#8217;est un
          proc&egrave;s jug&eacute; et non plaid&eacute;</i>,&#8221;
        r&eacute;pondait Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s, avec la finesse d&#8217;un
        jurisconsulte courtisan. &#8212; (Hippolyte Carnot &#8212; Notice sur
        Bar&egrave;re, p. 109; Paris, 1842.)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now it is the purpose of the philosopher, first to bring this
      omission of the pleadings into conscious notice &#8212; next to
      discover, evolve, and bring under hearing the matters omitted, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1pageviii" id="v1pageviii"></a>viii</span>
      as far as they suggest themselves to his individual reason. He
      claims for himself, and he ought to claim for all others alike,
      the right of calling for proof where others believe without proof
      &#8212; of rejecting the received doctrines, if upon examination the
      proof given appears to his mind unsound or insufficient &#8212; and of
      enforcing instead of them any others which impress themselves upon
      his mind as true. But the truth which he tenders for acceptance
      must of necessity be <i>reasoned truth</i>; supported by proofs,
      defended by adequate replies against preconsidered objections from
      others. Only hereby does it properly belong to the history of
      philosophy: hardly even hereby has any such novelty a chance of
      being fairly weighed and appreciated. </p>
    <p>When we thus advert to the vocation of philosophy, we see that
      (to use the phrase of an acute modern author<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_P_2" href="#Footnotev1_P_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>)
      it is by necessity polemical: the assertion of independent reason
      by individual reasoners, who dissent from the unreasoning belief
      which reigns authoritative in the social atmosphere around them,
      and who recognise no correction or <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1pageix" id="v1pageix"></a>ix</span> refutation except
      from the counter-reason of others. We see besides, that these
      dissenters from the public will also be, probably, more or less
      dissenters from each other. The process of philosophy may be
      differently performed by two enquirers equally free and sincere,
      even of the same age and country: and it is sure to be differently
      performed, if they belong to ages and countries widely apart. It
      is essentially relative to the individual reasoning mind, and to
      the medium by which the reasoner is surrounded. Philosophy herself
      has every thing to gain by such dissent; for it is only thereby
      that the weak and defective points of each point of view are
      likely to be exposed. If unanimity is not attained, at least each
      of the dissentients will better understand what he rejects as well
      as what he adopts. </p>

        Professor Ferrier, in his instructive volume, &#8216;The Institutes of
        Metaphysic,&#8217; has some valuable remarks on the scope and purpose
        of Philosophy. I transcribe some of them, in abridgment. </p>
      <p>(Sections 1-8) &#8220;A system of philosophy is bound by two main
        requisitions: it ought to be true &#8212; and it ought to be reasoned.
        Philosophy, in its ideal perfection, is a body of reasoned
        truth. Of these obligations, the latter is the more stringent.
        It is more proper that philosophy should be reasoned, than that
        it should be true: because, while truth may perhaps be
        unattainable by man, to reason is certainly his province and
        within his power.&#8230; A system is of the highest value only when it
        embraces both these requisitions &#8212; that is, when it is both
        true, and reasoned. But a system which is reasoned without being
        true, is always of higher value than a system which is true
        without being reasoned. The latter kind of system is of no
        value: because philosophy is the attainment of truth <i>by the
          way of reason</i>. That is its definition. A system,
        therefore, which reaches the truth but not by the way of reason,
        is not philosophy at all, and has therefore no scientific worth.
        Again, an unreasoned philosophy, even though true, carries no
        guarantee of its truth. It may be true, but it cannot be
        certain. On the other hand, a system, which is reasoned without
        being true, has always some value. It creates reason by
        exercising it. It is employing the proper means to reach truth,
        though it may fail to reach it.&#8221; (Sections 38-41) &#8212; &#8220;The student
        will find that the system here submitted to his attention is of
        a very polemical character. Why! Because philosophy exists only
        to correct the inadvertencies of man&#8217;s ordinary thinking. She
        has no other mission to fulfil. If man naturally thinks aright,
        he need not be taught to think aright. If he is already in
        possession of the truth, he does not require to be put in
        possession of it. The occupation of philosophy is gone: her
        office is superfluous. Therefore philosophy assumes and must
        assume that man does not naturally think aright, but must be
        taught to do so: that truth does not come to him spontaneously,
        but must be brought to him by his own exertions. If man does not
        naturally think aright, he must think, we shall not say wrongly
        (for that implies malice prepense) but inadvertently: the native
        occupant of his mind must be, we shall not say falsehood (for
        that too implies malice prepense) but error. The original dowry
        then of universal man is inadvertency and error. This assumption
        is the ground and only justification of the existence of
        philosophy. The circumstance that philosophy exists only to put
        right the oversights of common thinking &#8212; renders her polemical
        not by choice, but by necessity. She is controversial as the
        very tenure and condition of her existence: for how can she
        correct the slips of common opinion, the oversights of natural
        thinking, except by controverting them?&#8221; Professor Ferrier
        deserves high commendation for the care taken in this volume to
        set out clearly Proposition and Counter-Proposition: the thesis
        which he impugns, as well as that which he sustains.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The number of individual intellects, independent, inquisitive,
      and acute, is always rare everywhere; but was comparatively less
      rare in these ages of Greece. The first topic, on which such
      intellects broke loose from the common consciousness of the world
      around them, and struck out new points of view for themselves, was
      in reference to the Kosmos or the Universe. The received belief,
      of a multitude of unseen divine persons bringing about by
      volitions all the different phenomena of nature, became
      unsatisfactory to men like Thales, Anaximander, Parmenides,
      Pythagoras, Anaxagoras. Each of these volunteers, following his
      own independent inspirations, struck out a new hypothesis, and
      endeavoured <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1pagex" id="v1pagex"></a>x</span>
      to commend it to others with more or less of sustaining reason.
      There appears to have been little of negation or refutation in
      their procedure. None of them tried to disprove the received point
      of view, or to throw its supporters upon their defence. Each of
      them unfolded his own hypothesis, or his own version of
      affirmative reasoned truth, for the adoption of those with whom it
      might find favour. </p>
    <p>The dialectic age had not yet arrived. When it did arrive, with
      Sokrates as its principal champion, the topics of philosophy were
      altered, and its process revolutionised. We have often heard
      repeated the Ciceronian dictum &#8212; that Sokrates brought philosophy
      down from the heavens to the earth: from the distant, abstruse,
      and complicated phenomena of the Kosmos &#8212; in respect to which he
      adhered to the vulgar point of view, and even disapproved any
      enquiries tending to rationalise it &#8212; to the familiar business of
      man, and the common generalities of ethics and politics. But what
      has been less observed about Sokrates, though not less true, is,
      that along with this change of topics he introduced a complete
      revolution in method. He placed the negative in the front of his
      procedure; giving to it a point, an emphasis, a substantive value,
      which no one had done before. His peculiar gift was that of
      cross-examination, or the application of his Elenchus to
      discriminate pretended from real knowledge. He found men full of
      confident beliefs on these ethical and political topics &#8212;
      affirming with words which they had never troubled themselves to
      define &#8212; and persuaded that they required no farther teaching: yet
      at the same time unable to give clear or consistent answers to his
      questions, and shown by this convincing test to be destitute of
      real knowledge. Declaring this false persuasion of knowledge, or
      confident unreasoned belief, to be universal, he undertook, as the
      mission of his life, to expose it: and he proclaimed that until
      the mind was disabused thereof and made pain<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1pagexi" id="v1pagexi"></a>xi</span>fully conscious of
      ignorance, no affirmative reasoned truth could be presented with
      any chance of success. </p>
    <p>Such are the peculiar features of the Sokratic dialogue,
      exemplified in the compositions here reviewed. I do not mean that
      Sokrates always talked so; but that such was the marked
      peculiarity which distinguished his talking from that of others.
      It is philosophy, or reasoned truth, approached in the most
      polemical manner; operative at first only to discredit the
      natural, unreasoned intellectual growths of the ordinary mind, and
      to generate a painful consciousness of ignorance. I say this here,
      and I shall often say it again throughout these volumes. It is
      absolutely indispensable to the understanding of the Platonic
      dialogues; one half of which must appear unmeaning, unless
      construed with reference to this separate function and value of
      negative dialectic. Whether readers may themselves agree in such
      estimation of negative dialectic, is another question: but they
      must keep it in mind as the governing sentiment of Plato during
      much of his life, and of Sokrates throughout the whole of life: as
      being moreover one main cause of that antipathy which Sokrates
      inspired to many respectable orthodox contemporaries. I have
      thought it right to take constant account of this orthodox
      sentiment among the ordinary public, as the perpetual drag-chain,
      even when its force is not absolutely repressive, upon free
      speculation. </p>
    <p>Proceeding upon this general view, I have interpreted the
      numerous negative dialogues in Plato as being really negative and
      nothing beyond. I have not presumed, still less tried to divine,
      an ulterior Affirmative beyond what the text reveals &#8212; neither <i>arcana



        c&#339;lestia</i>, like Proklus and Ficinus,<a name="FnAnchorv1_P_3"
        href="#Footnotev1_P_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> nor any
      other <i>arcanum</i> of terrestrial character. While giving such
      an analysis of each dialogue as my space permitted and <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1pagexii" id="v1pagexii"></a>xii</span>
      as will enable the reader to comprehend its general scope and
      peculiarities &#8212; I have studied each as it stands written, and have
      rarely ascribed to Plato any purpose exceeding what he himself
      intimates. Where I find difficulties forcibly dwelt upon without
      any solution, I imagine, not that he had a good solution kept back
      in his closet, but that he had failed in finding one: that he
      thought it useful, as a portion of the total process necessary for
      finding and authenticating reasoned truth, both to work out these
      unsolved difficulties for himself, and to force them impressively
      upon the attention of others.<a name="FnAnchorv1_P_4"

        A striking passage from Bentham illustrates very well both the
        Sokratic and the Platonic point of view. (Principles of Morals
        and Legislation, vol. ii. ch. xvi. p. 57, ed. 1823.) </p>
      <p>&#8220;Gross ignorance descries no difficulties. Imperfect knowledge
        finds them out and struggles with them. It must be perfect
        knowledge that overcomes them.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Of the three different mental conditions here described, the
        first is that against which Sokrates made war, <i>i.e.</i> real
        ignorance, and false persuasion of knowledge, which therefore
        descries no difficulties. </p>
      <p>The second, or imperfect knowledge struggling with
        difficulties, is represented by the Platonic negative dialogues.
      </p>
      <p>The third &#8212; or perfect knowledge victorious over difficulties &#8212;
        will be found in the following pages marked by the character &#964;&#8056;
        &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;. You do not possess &#8220;perfect
        knowledge,&#8221; until you are able to answer, with unfaltering
        promptitude and consistency, all the questions of a Sokratic
        cross-examiner &#8212; and to administer effectively the like
        cross-examination yourself, for the purpose of testing others.
        &#8011;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;.
        (Aristotel. Metaphys. A. 981, b. 8.) </p>
      <p>Perfect knowledge, corresponding to this definition, will not
        be found manifested in Plato. Instead of it, we note in his
        latter years the lawgiver&#8217;s assumed infallibility.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Moreover, I deal with each dialogue as a separate composition.
      Each represents the intellectual scope and impulse of a peculiar
      moment, which may or may not be in harmony with the rest. Plato
      would have protested not less earnestly than Cicero,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_P_5" href="#Footnotev1_P_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
      against those who sought to foreclose debate, in the grave and
      arduous struggles for searching out reasoned truth &#8212; and to bind
      down the free inspirations of his intellect in one dialogue, by
      appealing to sentence already pronounced <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1pagexiii" id="v1pagexiii"></a>xiii</span> in another
      preceding. Of two inconsistent trains of reasoning, both cannot
      indeed be true &#8212; but both are often useful to be known and
      studied: and the philosopher, who professes to master the theory
      of his subject, ought not to be a stranger to either. All minds
      athirst for reasoned truth will be greatly aided in forming their
      opinions by the number of points which Plato suggests, though they
      find little which he himself settles for them finally. </p>

      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_P_5"

        Cicero, Tusc. Disp. v. 11, 38.</p>
      <p>The collocutor remarks that what Cicero says is inconsistent
        with what he (Cicero) had written in the fourth book De Finibus.
        To which Cicero replies:&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Tu quidem tabellis obsignatis agis mecum, et testificaris,
        quid dixerim aliquando aut scripserim. Cum aliis isto modo, qui
        legibus impositis disputant. Nos in diem vivimus: quodcunque
        nostros animos probabilitate percussit, id dicimus: itaque soli
        sumus liberi.&#8221;</p>
    </div>
    <p>There have been various critics, who, on perceiving
      inconsistencies in Plato, either force them into harmony by a
      subtle exeg&ecirc;sis, or discard one of them as spurious.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_P_6" href="#Footnotev1_P_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
      I have not followed either course. I recognise such
      inconsistencies, when found, as facts &#8212; and even as very
      interesting facts &#8212; in his philosophical character. To the marked
      contradiction in the spirit of the Leges, as compared with the
      earlier Platonic compositions, I have called special attention.
      Plato has been called by Plutarch a mixture of Sokrates with
      Lykurgus. The two elements are in reality opposite, predominant at
      different times: Plato begins his career with the confessed
      ignorance and philosophical negative of Sokrates: he closes it
      with the peremptory, dictatorial, affirmative of Lykurgus. </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_P_6"

        Since the publication of the first edition of this work, there
        have appeared valuable commentaries on the philosophy of the
        late Sir William Hamilton, by Mr. John Stuart Mill, and Mr.
        Stirling and others. They have exposed inconsistencies, both
        grave and numerous, in some parts of Sir William Hamilton&#8217;s
        writings as compared with others. But no one has dreamt of
        drawing an inference from this fact, that one or other of the
        inconsistent trains of reasoning must be spurious, falsely
        ascribed to Sir William Hamilton. </p>
      <p>Now in the case of Plato, this same fact of inconsistency is
        accepted by nearly all his commentators as a sound basis for the
        inference that both the inconsistent treatises cannot be
        genuine: though the dramatic character of Plato&#8217;s writings makes
        inconsistencies much more easily supposable than in dogmatic
        treatises such as those of Hamilton.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To Xenophon, who belongs only in part to my present work, and
      whose character presents an interesting contrast with Plato, I
      have devoted a separate chapter. To the other less celebrated
      Sokratic Companions also, I have endeavoured to do justice, as far
      as the scanty means of knowledge permit: <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1pagexiv" id="v1pagexiv"></a>xiv</span> to them,
      especially, because they have generally been misconceived and
      unduly depreciated. </p>
    <p>The present volumes, however, contain only one half of the
      speculative activity of Hellas during the fourth century <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> The second half, in which Aristotle is
      the hero, remains still wanting. If my health and energies
      continue, I hope one day to be able to supply this want: and thus
      to complete from my own point of view, the history, speculative as
      well as active, of the Hellenic race, down to the date which I
      prescribed to myself in the Preface of my History near twenty
      years ago. </p>
    <p>The philosophy of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      is peculiarly valuable and interesting, not merely from its
      intrinsic speculative worth &#8212; from the originality and grandeur of
      its two principal heroes &#8212; from its coincidence with the full
      display of dramatic, rhetorical, artistic genius &#8212; but also from a
      fourth reason not unimportant &#8212; because it is purely Hellenic;
      preceding the development of Alexandria, and the amalgamation of
      Oriental veins of thought with the inspirations of the Academy or
      the Lyceum. The Orontes<a name="FnAnchorv1_P_7"
        href="#Footnotev1_P_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and the
      Jordan had not yet begun to flow westward, and to impart their own
      colour to the waters of Attica and Latium. Not merely the real
      world, but also the ideal world, present to the minds of Plato and
      Aristotle, were purely Hellenic. Even during the century
      immediately following, this had ceased to be fully true in respect
      to the philosophers of Athens: and it became less and less true
      with each succeeding century. New foreign centres of rhetoric and
      literature &#8212; Asiatic and Alexandrian Hellenism &#8212; were fostered
      into importance by regal encouragement. Plato and Aristotle are
      thus the special representatives of genuine Hellenic philosophy.
      The remarkable intellectual ascendancy acquired by them in their
      own day, and maintained over succeeding centuries, was <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1pagexv" id="v1pagexv"></a>xv</span>
      one main reason why the Hellenic vein was enabled so long to
      maintain itself, though in impoverished condition, against adverse
      influences from the East, ever increasing in force. Plato and
      Aristotle outlasted all their Pagan successors &#8212; successors at
      once less purely Hellenic and less highly gifted. And when Saint
      Jerome, near 750 years after the decease of Plato, commemorated
      with triumph the victory of unlettered Christians over the
      accomplishments and genius of Paganism &#8212; he illustrated the
      magnitude of the victory, by singling out Plato and Aristotle as
      the representatives of vanquished philosophy.<a

        Greece during the life of Plato.</span> </p>
    <p>The life of Plato extends from 427-347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      He was born in the fourth year of the Peloponnesian war, and he
      died at the age of 80, about the time when Olynthus was taken by
      the Macedonian Philip. The last years of his life thus witnessed a
      melancholy breach in the integrity of the Hellenic world, and even
      exhibited data from which a far-sighted Hellenic politician might
      have anticipated something like the coming subjugation, realised
      afterwards by the victory of Philip at Ch&aelig;roneia. But during
      the first half of Plato&#8217;s life, no such anticipations seemed even
      within the limits of possibility. The forces of Hellas, though
      discordant among themselves, were superabundant as to defensive
      efficacy, and were disposed rather to aggression against foreign
      enemies, especially against a country then so little formidable as
      Macedonia. It was under this contemplation of Hellas self-acting
      and self-sufficing &#8212; an aggregate of cities, each a political
      unit, yet held together by strong ties of race, language,
      religion, and common feelings of various kinds &#8212; that the mind of
      Plato was both formed and matured. </p>
    <p>In appreciating, as far as our scanty evidence allows, the
      circumstances which determined his intellectual and speculative <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page2" id="v1page2"></a>2</span>
      character, I shall be compelled to touch briefly upon the various
      philosophical theories which were propounded anterior to Sokrates
      &#8212; as well as to repeat some matters already brought to view in the
      sixteenth, sixty-seventh, and sixty-eighth chapters of my History
      of Greece. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_1_2"
          id="Sidenotev1_1_2"></a>Early Greek mind, satisfied with the
        belief in polytheistic personal agents as the real producing
        causes of phenomena. </span></p>
    <p>To us, as to Herodotus, in his day, the philosophical speculation
      of the Greeks begins with the theology and cosmology of Homer and
      Hesiod. The series of divine persons and attributes, and
      generations presented by these poets, and especially the Theogony
      of Hesiod, supplied at one time full satisfaction to the curiosity
      of the Greeks respecting the past history and present agencies of
      the world around them. In the emphatic censure bestowed by
      Herakleitus on the poets and philosophers who preceded him, as
      having much knowledge but no sense &#8212; he includes Hesiod, as well
      as Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Hekat&aelig;us: upon Homer and
      Archilochus he is still more severe, declaring that they ought to
      be banished from the public festivals and scourged.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_1" href="#Footnotev1_1_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
      The sentiment of curiosity as it then existed was only secondary
      and derivative, arising out of some of the strong primary or
      personal sentiments &#8212; fear or hope, antipathy or sympathy, &#8212;
      impression of present weakness, &#8212; unsatisfied appetites and
      longings, &#8212; wonder and awe under the presence of the
      terror-striking phenomena of nature, &amp;c. Under this state of
      the mind, when problems suggested themselves for solution, the
      answers afforded by Polytheism gave more satisfaction than could
      have been afforded by any other hypothesis. Among the indefinite
      multitude of invisible, personal, quasi-human agents, with
      different attributes and dispositions, some one could be found to
      account for every perplexing phenomenon. The question asked was,
      not What are the antecedent conditions or causes of rain, thunder,
      or earthquakes, but Who rains and thunders? Who produces
      earthquakes?<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_2" href="#Footnotev1_1_2"><span
          class="sp">2</span></a> The Hesiodic Greek was satisfied when
      informed that it was Zeus or Poseidon. To be told of physical
      agencies would have appeared to him not merely <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page3" id="v1page3"></a>3</span>
      unsatisfactory, but absurd, ridiculous, and impious. It was the
      task of a poet like Hesiod to clothe this general polytheistic
      sentiment in suitable details: to describe the various Gods,
      Goddesses, Demigods, and other quasi-human agents, with their
      characteristic attributes, with illustrative adventures, and with
      sufficient relations of sympathy and subordination among each
      other, to connect them in men&#8217;s imaginations as members of the
      same brotherhood. Okeanus, G&aelig;a, Uranus, Helios,
      Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc;, &#8212; Zeus, Poseidon, Hades &#8212; Apollo and Artemis,
      Dionysus and Aphrodit&ecirc; &#8212; these and many other divine
      personal agents, were invoked as the producing and sustaining
      forces in nature, the past history of which was contained in their
      filiations or contests. Anterior to all of them, the primordial
      matter or person, was Chaos. </p>

        the hypothesis of physical agency in place of personal. Water,
        the primordial substance, or &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942;. </span></p>
    <p>Even in the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when
      the habit of composing in prose was first introduced, Pherekydes
      and Akusilaus still continued in their prose the theogony, or the
      mythical cosmogony, of Hesiod and the other old Poets: while
      Epimenides and the Orphic poets put forth different theogonies,
      blended with mystical dogmas. It was, however, in the same
      century, and in the first half of it, that Thales of Miletus
      (620-560 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), set the example of a
      new vein of thought. Instead of the Homeric Okeanus, father of all
      things, Thales assumed the material substance, Water, as the
      primordial matter and the universal substratum of everything in
      nature. By various transmutations, all other substances were
      generated from water; all of them, when destroyed, returned into
      water. Like the old poets, Thales conceived the surface of the
      earth to be flat and round; but he did not, like them, regard it
      as stretching down to the depths of Tartarus: he supposed it to be
      flat and shallow, floating on the immensity of the watery expanse
      or Ocean.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_6" href="#Footnotev1_1_6"><span
          class="sp">6</span></a> This is the main feature of the
      Thaletian hypothesis, about which, however, its author seems to
      have left no writing. Aristotle says little about Thales, and that
      little in a tone of so much doubt,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_7"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> that we can

      <p>According to Plutarch (Aqu&aelig; et Ignis Comparatio, p. 955,
        init.), most persons believed that Hesiod, by the word Chaos,
        meant Water. Zeno the Stoic adopted this interpretation (Schol.
        Apollon. Rhod. i. 498). On the other hand, Bacchylides the poet,
        and after him Zenodotus, called Air by the name Chaos (Schol.
        Hesiod. Theogon. p. 392, Gaisf.). Hermann considers that the
        Hesiodic Chaos means empty space (see note, Brandis, Handb. d.

        Cicero says (De Natur&acirc; Deorum, i. 10), &#8220;Thales &#8212; aquam
        dixit esse initium rerum, Deum autem eam mentem, qu&aelig; ex
        aqu&acirc; cuncta fingeret.&#8221; That the latter half of this
        Ciceronian statement, respecting the doctrines of Thales, is at
        least unfounded, and probably erroneous, is recognised by
        Preller, Brandis, and Zeller. Preller, Histor. Philos.

      <p>It is stated by Herodotus that Thales foretold the year of the
        memorable solar eclipse which happened during the battle between
        the Medes and the Lydians (Herod. i. 74). This eclipse seems to
        have occurred in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 585, according
        to the best recent astronomical enquiries by Professor Airy.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_1_5"
          id="Sidenotev1_1_5"></a>Anaximander &#8212; laid down as &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942; the
        Infinite or indeterminate &#8212; generation of the elements out of
        it, by evolution of latent fundamental contraries &#8212; astronomical
        and geological doctrines.</span> </p>
    <p>The next of the Ionic philosophers, and the first who published <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page5" id="v1page5"></a>5</span>his
      opinions in writing, was Anaximander, of Miletus, the countryman
      and younger contemporary of Thales (570-520 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>).



      He too searched for an &#7944;&#961;&#967;&#942;, a primordial Something or principle,
      self-existent and comprehending in its own nature a generative,
      motive, or transmutative force. Not thinking that water, or any
      other known and definite substance fulfilled these conditions, he
      adopted as the foundation of his hypothesis a substance which he
      called the Infinite or Indeterminate. Under this name he conceived
      Body simply, without any positive or determinate properties, yet
      including the fundamental contraries, Hot, Cold, Moist, Dry,
      &amp;c., in a potential or latent state, including farther a
      self-changing and self-developing force,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_9"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> and being
      moreover immortal and indestructible.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_10"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> By this
      inherent force, and by the evolution of one or more of these
      dormant contrary qualities, were generated the various definite
      substances of nature &#8212; Air, Fire, Water, &amp;c. But every
      determinate substance thus generated was, after a certain time,
      destroyed and resolved again into the Indeterminate mass. &#8220;From
      thence all substances proceed, and into this they relapse: each in
      its turn thus making atonement to the others, and suffering the
      penalty of injustice.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_11"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
      Anaximander conceived separate existence (determinate and
      particular existence, apart from the indeterminate and universal)
      as an unjust privilege, not to be tolerated <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page6" id="v1page6"></a>6</span> except for a time,
      and requiring atonement even for that. As this process of
      alternate generation and destruction was unceasing, so nothing
      less than an Infinite could supply material for it. Earth, Water,
      Air, Fire, having been generated, the two former, being cold and
      heavy, remained at the bottom, while the two latter ascended. Fire
      formed the exterior circle, encompassing the air like bark round a
      tree: this peripheral fire was broken up and aggregated into
      separate masses, composing the sun, moon, and stars. The sphere of
      the fixed stars was nearest to the earth: that of the moon next
      above it: that of the sun highest of all. The sun and moon were
      circular bodies twenty-eight times larger than the earth: but the
      visible part of them was only an opening in the centre, through
      which<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_12" href="#Footnotev1_1_12"><span
          class="sp">12</span></a> the fire or light behind was seen.
      All these spheres revolved round the earth, which was at first
      semi-fluid or mud, but became dry and solid through the heat of
      the sun. It was in shape like the section of a cylinder, with a
      depth equal to one-third of its breadth or horizontal surface, on
      which men and animals live. It was in the centre of the Kosmos; it
      remained stationary because of its equal distance from all parts
      of the outer revolving spheres; there was no cause determining it
      to move upward rather than downward or sideways, therefore it
      remained still.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_13" href="#Footnotev1_1_13"><span
          class="sp">13</span></a> Its exhalations nourished the fire in
      the peripheral regions of the Kosmos. Animals were produced from
      the primitive muddy fluid of the earth: first, fishes and other
      lower animals &#8212; next, in process of time man, when circumstances
      permitted his development.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_14"

      learn farther respecting the doctrines of Anaximander, that he
      proposed physical explanations of thunder, lightning, and other
      meteorological phenomena:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_15"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> memorable
      as the earliest attempt of speculation in that department, at a
      time when such events inspired the strongest religious awe, and
      were regarded as the most especial manifestations of purposes of
      the Gods. He is said also to have been the first who tried to
      represent the surface and divisions of the earth on a brazen
      plate, the earliest rudiment of a map or chart.<a

      <p>Anaximander conceived &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957; as <i>infinite matter</i>;
        the Pythagoreans and Plato conceived it as a distinct nature by
        itself &#8212; as a subject, not as a predicate (Aristotel. Physic.
        iii. 4, p. 203, a. 2). </p>
      <p>About these fundamental contraries, Aristotle says (Physic. i.
        4, init.): &#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8217; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#7953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#962;

      <p>Compare also Schleiermacher, &#8220;Ueber Anaximandros,&#8221; in his
        Vermischte Schriften, vol. ii. p. 178, seq. Deutinger (Gesch.
        der Philos. vol. i. p. 165, Regensb. 1852) maintains that this
        &#7956;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; of contraries is at variance with the hypothesis of
        Anaximander, and has been erroneously ascribed to him. But the

        were caused by the occasional closing of these apertures (Euseb.
        xv. 50-61). The part of the sun visible to us was, in his
        opinion, not smaller than the earth, and of the purest fire
        (Diog. Laert. ii. 1). </p>
      <p>Eud&ecirc;mus, in his history of astronomy, mentioned
        Anaximander as the first who had discussed the magnitudes and
        distances of the celestial bodies (Simplikius ad Aristot. De
        C&#339;lo, ap. Schol. Brand, p. 497, a. 12).</p>

      <p>The reason here assigned by Anaximander why the Earth remained
        still, is the earliest example in Greek philosophy of that
        fallacy called the principle of the Sufficient Reason, so well

        Strabo, i. p. 7. Diogenes Laertius (ii. 1) states that
        Anaximander affirmed the figure of the earth to be spherical;
        and Dr. Whewell, in his History of the Inductive Sciences,
        follows his statement. But Schleiermacher (Ueber Anaximandros,
        vol. ii. p. 204 of his S&auml;mmtliche Werke) and Gruppe (Die
        Kosmischen Systeme der Griechen, p. 38) contest this assertion,
        and prefer that of Plutarch (ap. Eusebium Pr&aelig;p. Evang. i.
        8, Placit. Philos. iii. 10), which I have adopted in the text.
        It is to be remembered that Diogenes himself, in another place
        (ix. 3, 21), affirms Parmenides to have been the first who
        propounded the spherical figure of the earth. See the facts upon
        this subject collected and discussed in the instructive

        rise of substances out of it, by condensation and rarefaction. </span></p>
    <p>The third physical philosopher produced by Miletus, seemingly
      before the time of her terrible disasters suffered from the
      Persians after the Ionic revolt between 500-494 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, was Anaximenes, who struck out a
      third hypothesis. He assumed, as the primordial substance, and as
      the source of all generation or transmutation, Air, eternal in
      duration, infinite in extent. He thus returned to the principle of
      the Thaletian theory, selecting for his beginning a known
      substance, though not the same substance as Thales. To explain how
      generation of new products was possible (as Anaximander had tried
      to explain by his theory of evolution of latent contraries),
      Anaximenes adverted to the facts of condensation and rarefaction,
      which he connected respectively with cold and heat.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_17" href="#Footnotev1_1_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
      The Infinite Air, possessing and exercising an inherent generative
      and developing power, perpetually in motion, passing from dense to
      rare or from rare to dense, became in its utmost rarefaction, Fire
      and &AElig;ther; when passing through successive stages of
      increased condensation it became first cloud, next water, then
      earth, and, lastly, in its <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page8" id="v1page8"></a>8</span> utmost density,
      stone.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_18" href="#Footnotev1_1_18"><span
          class="sp">18</span></a> Surrounding, embracing, and pervading
      the Kosmos, it also embodied and carried with it a vital
      principle, which animals obtained from it by inspiration, and
      which they lost as soon as they ceased to breathe.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_19" href="#Footnotev1_1_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
      Anaximenes included in his treatise (which was written in a clear
      Ionic dialect) many speculations on astronomy and meteorology,
      differing widely from those of Anaximander. He conceived the Earth
      as a broad, flat, round plate, resting on the air.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_20" href="#Footnotev1_1_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
      Earth, Sun, and Moon were in his view condensed air, the Sun
      acquiring heat by the extreme and incessant velocity with which he
      moved. The Heaven was not an entire hollow sphere encompassing the
      Earth below as well as above, but a hemisphere covering the Earth
      above, and revolving laterally round it like a cap round the head.<a

      others, especially by Diogenes of Apollonia, of whom I shall speak
      presently. But there were three other men who struck out different
      veins of thought &#8212; Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Herakleitus: the
      two former seemingly contemporary with Anaximenes (550-490 <span

    <p>Of Pythagoras I have spoken at some length in the thirty-seventh
      chapter of my History of Greece. Speculative originality was only
      one among many remarkable features in his character. He was an
      inquisitive traveller, a religious reformer or innovator, and the
      founder of a powerful and active brotherhood, partly ascetic,
      partly political, which stands without parallel in Grecian
      history. The immortality of the soul, with its transmigration
      (metempsychosis) after death into other bodies, either <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page9" id="v1page9"></a>9</span> of
      men or of other animals &#8212; the universal kindred thus recognised
      between men and other animals, and the prohibition which he
      founded thereupon against the use of animals for food or sacrifice
      &#8212; are among his most remarkable doctrines: said to have been
      borrowed (together with various ceremonial observances) from the
      Egyptians.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_22" href="#Footnotev1_1_22"><span
          class="sp">22</span></a> After acquiring much celebrity in his
      native island of Samos and throughout Ionia, Pythagoras emigrated
      (seemingly about 530 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) to Kroton
      and Metapontum in Lower Italy, where the Pythagorean brotherhood
      gradually acquired great political ascendancy: and from whence it
      even extended itself in like manner over the neighbouring
      Greco-Italian cities. At length it excited so much political
      antipathy among the body of the citizens,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_23"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> that its
      rule was violently put down, and its members dispersed about 509 <span

    <p>Though thus stripped of power, however, the Pythagoreans still
      maintained themselves for several generations as a social,
      religious, and philosophical brotherhood. They continued and
      extended the vein of speculation first opened by the founder
      himself. So little of proclaimed individuality was there among
      them, that Aristotle, in criticising their doctrine, alludes to
      them usually under the collective name Pythagoreans. Epicharmus,
      in his comedies at Syracuse (470 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)
      gave occasional utterance to various doctrines of the sect; but
      the earliest of them who is known to have composed a book, was
      Philolaus,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_24" href="#Footnotev1_1_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> the contemporary of Sokrates. Most of
      the opinions ascribed to the Pythagoreans originated probably
      among the successors of Pythagoras; but the basis and principle
      upon which they proceed seems undoubtedly his. </p>

      <p>Some passages of Aristotle, however, indicate divergences of
        doctrine among the Pythagoreans themselves (Metaphys. A. 5, p.
        986, a. 22). He probably speaks of the Pythagoreans of his own
        time when dialectical discussion had modified the original
        orthodoxy of the order. Compare Gruppe, Ueber die Fragmente des
        Archytas, cap. 5, p. 61-63. About the gradual development of the

          id="Sidenotev1_1_9"></a>Doctrine of the Pythagoreans &#8212; Number
        the Essence of Things. </span></p>
    <p>The problem of physical philosophy, as then conceived, was <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page10" id="v1page10"></a>10</span>
      to find some primordial and fundamental nature, by and out of
      which the sensible universe was built up and produced; something
      which co-existed always underlying it, supplying fresh matter and
      force for generation of successive products. The hypotheses of
      Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, to solve this problem, have
      been already noticed: Pythagoras solved it by saying, That the
      essence of things consisted in Number. By this he did not mean
      simply that all things were numerable, or that number belonged to
      them as a predicate. Numbers were not merely predicates
      inseparable from subjects, but subjects in themselves: substances
      or magnitudes, endowed with active force, and establishing the
      fundamental essences or types according to which things were
      constituted. About water,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_25"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> air, or
      fire, Pythagoras said nothing.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_26"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> He
      conceived that sensible phenomena had greater resemblance to
      numbers than to any one of these substrata assigned by the Ionic
      philosophers. Number was (in his doctrine) the self-existent
      reality &#8212; the fundamental material and in-dwelling force pervading
      the universe. Numbers were not separate from things<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_27" href="#Footnotev1_1_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a>
      (like the Platonic Ideas), but <i>fundamenta</i> of things &#8212;
      their essences or determining principles: they were moreover
      conceived as having magnitude and active force.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_28" href="#Footnotev1_1_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
      In the movements of the celestial bodies, in works of human art,
      in musical harmony &#8212; measure and number are the producing and
      directing agencies. According to the Pythagorean Philolaus, &#8220;the
      Dekad, the full and perfect number, was of supreme and universal
      efficacy as the guide and principle of life, both to the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page11" id="v1page11"></a>11</span>
      Kosmos and to man. The nature of number was imperative and
      lawgiving, affording the only solution of all that was perplexing
      or unknown; without number all would be indeterminate and
      unknowable.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_29" href="#Footnotev1_1_29"><span

        An analogous application of this principle (Number as the
        fundamental substance and universal primary agent) may be seen
        in an eminent physical philosopher of the nineteenth century,
        Oken&#8217;s Elements of Physio-Philosophy, translated by Tulk.
        Aphorism 57:&#8212;&#8220;While numbers in a mathematical sense are
        positions and negations of nothing, in the philosophical sense
        they are positions and negations of the Eternal. Every thing
        which is real, posited, finite, has become this, out of numbers;
        or more strictly speaking, every Real is absolutely nothing else
        than a number. This must be the sense entertained of numbers in
        the Pythagorean doctrine &#8212; namely, that every thing, or the
        whole universe, had arisen from numbers. This is not to be taken
        in a merely quantitative sense, as it has hitherto been
        erroneously; but in an intrinsic sense, as implying that all
        things are numbers themselves, or the acts of the Eternal. The
        essence in numbers is nought else than the Eternal. The Eternal
        only is or exists, and nothing else is when a number exists.
        There is therefore nothing real but the Eternal itself; for
        every Real, or every thing that is, is only a number and only
        exists by virtue of a number.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Ibid., Aphorism 105-107:&#8212;&#8220;Arithmetic is the science of the
        second idea, or that of time or motion, or life. It is therefore
        the first science. Mathematics not only begin with it, but
        creation also, with the becoming of time and of life. Arithmetic
        is, accordingly, the truly absolute or divine science; and
        therefore every thing in it is also directly certain, because
        every thing in it resembles the Divine. Theology is arithmetic
        personified.&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;A natural thing is nothing but a self-moving
        number. An organic or living thing is a number moving itself out
        of itself or spontaneously: an inorganic thing, however, is a
        number moved by another thing: now as this other thing is also a
        real number, so then is every inorganic thing a number moved by
        another number, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. The movements in
        nature are only movements of numbers by numbers: even as
        arithmetical computation is none other than a movement of
        numbers by numbers; but with this difference &#8212; that in the
        latter, this operates in an ideal manner, in the former after a
        real.&#8221;</p>

      first in order of time, and in order of philosophical conception.
      By the determining influence of this central constituted One,
      portions of the surrounding Infinite were successively attracted
      and brought into system: numbers, geometrical figures, solid
      substances, were generated. But as the Kosmos thus constituted was
      composed of numbers, there could be no continuum: each numerical
      unit was distinct and separated from the rest by a portion of
      vacant space, which was imbibed, by a sort of inhalation, from the
      infinite space or spirit without.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_36"

      The central point was fire, called by the Pythagoreans the Hearth
      of the Universe (like the public hearth or perpetual fire
      maintained in the prytaneum of a Grecian city), or the watch-tower
      of Zeus. Around it revolved, from West to East, ten divine bodies,
      with unequal velocities, but in symmetrical movement or regular
      dance.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_37" href="#Footnotev1_1_37"><span

      like the centre. Within this came successively, &#8212; with orbits more
      and more approximating to the centre, &#8212; the five planets, Saturn,
      Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury: next, the Sun, the Moon, and the
      Earth. Lastly, between the Earth and the central fire, an
      hypothetical body, called the Antichthon or Counter-Earth, was
      imagined for the purpose of making up a total represented by the
      sacred number Ten, the symbol of perfection and totality. The
      Antichthon was analogous to a separated half of the Earth;
      simultaneous with the Earth in its revolutions, and corresponding
      with it on the opposite side of the central fire. </p>

    <p>The inhabited portion of the Earth was supposed to be that which
      was turned away from the central fire and towards the Sun, from
      which it received light. But the Sun itself was not self-luminous:
      it was conceived as a glassy disk, receiving and concentrating
      light from the central fire, and reflecting it upon the Earth, so
      long as the two were on the same side of the central fire. The
      Earth revolved, in an orbit obliquely intersecting that of the
      Sun, and in twenty-four hours, round the central fire, always
      turning the same side towards that fire. The alternation of day
      and night was occasioned by the Earth being during a part of such
      revolution on the same side of the central fire with the Sun, and
      thus receiving light reflected from him: and during the remaining
      part of her revolution on the side opposite to him, so that she
      received no light at all from him. The Earth, with the Antichthon,
      made this revolution in one day: the Moon, in <span

      one month:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_38" href="#Footnotev1_1_38"><span

      and Venus, in one year: the planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in
      longer periods respectively, according to their distances from the
      centre: lastly, the outermost circle of the fixed stars (the
      Olympus, or the Aplanes), in some unknown period of very long
      duration.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_39" href="#Footnotev1_1_39"><span

        The Pythagoreans supposed that eclipses of the moon took place,
        sometimes by the interposition of the earth, sometimes by that
        of the Antichthon, to intercept from the moon the light of the
        sun (Stob&aelig;us, Eclog. Phys. i. 27, p. 560. Heeren).
        Stob&aelig;us here cites the history (&#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#957;) of the
        Pythagorean philosophy by Aristotle, and the statement of

        Aristot. de C&#339;lo, ii. 13. Respecting this Pythagorean cosmical
        system, the elucidations of Boeckh are clear and valuable.
        Untersuchungen &uuml;ber das Kosmische System des Platon,
        Berlin, 1852, p. 99-102; completing those which he had before
        given in his edition of the fragments of Philolaus. </p>
      <p>Martin (in his &Eacute;tudes sur le Tim&eacute;e de Platon,
        vol. ii. p. 107) and Gruppe (Die Kosmischen Systeme der
        Griechen, ch. iv.) maintain that the original system proposed by
        Pythagoras was a geocentric system, afterwards transformed by
        Philolaus and other Pythagoreans into that which stands in the
        text. But I agree with Boeckh (Ueber das Kosmische System des
        Platon, p. 89 seqq.), and with Zeller (Phil. d. Griech., vol. i.
        p. 308, ed. 2), that this point is not made out. That which
        Martin and Gruppe (on the authority of Alexander Polyhistor,
        Diog. viii. 25, and others) consider to be a description of the
        original Pythagorean system as it stood before Philolaus, is
        more probably a subsequent transformation of it; introduced
        after the time of Aristotle, in order to suit later astronomical
        views.</p>

    <p>The revolutions of such grand bodies could not take place, in the
      opinion of the Pythagoreans, without producing a loud and powerful
      sound; and as their distances from the central fire were supposed
      to be arranged in musical ratios,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_40"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> so the
      result of all these separate sounds was full and perfect harmony.
      To the objection &#8212; Why were not these sounds heard by us? &#8212; they
      replied, that we had heard them constantly and without
      intermission from the hour of our birth; hence they had become
      imperceptible by habit.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_41"

        Playfair observes (in his dissertation on the Progress of
        Natural Philosophy, p. 87) respecting Kepler &#8212; &#8220;Kepler was
        perhaps the first person who conceived that there must be always
        a law capable of being expressed by arithmetic or geometry,
        which connects such phenomena as have a physical dependence on
        each other&#8221;. But this seems to be exactly the fundamental
        conception of the Pythagoreans: or rather a part of their
        fundamental conception, for they also considered their numbers
        as active forces bringing such law into reality. To illustrate
        the determination of the Pythagoreans to make up the number of
        Ten celestial bodies, I transcribe another passage from Playfair
        (p. 98). Huygens, having discovered one satellite of Saturn,
        &#8220;believed that there were no more, and that the number of the
        planets was now complete. The planets, primary and secondary,
        thus made up twelve &#8212; the double of six, the first of the
        perfect numbers.&#8221;</p>

        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page15" id="v1page15"></a>15</span>
      and consummation of number. The numbers from One to Ten were all
      that they recognised as primary, original, generative. Numbers
      greater than ten were compounds and derivatives from the decad.
      They employed this perfect number not only as a basis on which to
      erect a bold astronomical hypothesis, but also as a sum total for
      their list of contraries. Many Hellenic philosophers<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_42" href="#Footnotev1_1_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
      recognised pairs of opposing attributes as pervading nature, and
      as the fundamental categories to which the actual varieties of the
      sensible world might be reduced. While others laid down Hot and
      Cold, Wet and Dry, as the fundamental contraries, the Pythagoreans
      adopted a list of ten pairs. 1. Limit and Unlimited; 2. Odd and
      Even; 3. One and Many; 4. Right and Left; 5. Male and Female; 6.
      Rest and Motion; 7. Straight and Curve; 8. Light and Darkness; 9.

      ten pairs, five belong to arithmetic or to geometry, one to
      mechanics, one to physics, and three to anthropology or ethics.
      Good and Evil, Regularity and Irregularity, were recognised as

        bitter, good and evil, great and little. All that you can
        extract from these philosophers is (continues Aristotle) the
        general axiom, that &#8220;contraries are the principia of existing
        things&#8221; &#8212; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#945; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;. </p>

    <p>The arithmetical and geometrical view of nature, to which such
      exclusive supremacy is here given by the Pythagoreans, is one of
      the most interesting features of Grecian philosophy. They were the
      earliest cultivators of mathematical science,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_45" href="#Footnotev1_1_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
      and are to be recognised as having paved the way for Euclid and

      with which they so largely perverted what are now regarded as the
      clearest and most rigorous processes of the human intellect. The
      important theorem which forms the forty-seventh Proposition of
      Euclid&#8217;s first book, is affirmed to have been discovered by
      Pythagoras himself: but how much progress was made by him and his

    <p>Contemporary with Pythagoras, and like him an emigrant from Ionia
      to Italy, was Xenophanes of Kolophon. He settled at the
      Phok&aelig;an colony of Elea, on the Gulf of Poseidonia; his life
      was very long, but his period of eminence appears to belong (as
      far as we can make out amidst conflicting testimony) to the last
      thirty years of the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      (530-500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>). He was thus
      contemporary with Anaximander and Anaximenes, as well as with
      Pythagoras, the last of whom he may have personally known.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_47" href="#Footnotev1_1_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
      He composed, and recited in person, poems &#8212; epic, elegiac, and
      iambic &#8212; of which a very few fragments remain. </p>

    <p>Xenophanes takes his point of departure, not from Thales or
      Anaximander, but from the same ancient theogonies which they had
      forsaken. But he follows a very different road. The most prominent
      feature in his poems (so far as they remain), is the directness
      and asperity with which he attacks the received opinions
      respecting the Gods &#8212; and the poets Hesiod and Homer, the popular
      exponents of those opinions. Xenophanes not only condemns these
      poets for having ascribed to the Gods discreditable exploits, but
      even calls in question the existence of the Gods, and ridicules
      the anthropomorphic conception which pervaded the Hellenic faith.
      &#8220;If horses or lions could paint, they would delineate their Gods
      in form like themselves. The Ethiopians conceive their Gods as
      black, the Thracians conceive theirs as fair and with reddish
      hair.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_48" href="#Footnotev1_1_48"><span

    <p>Though Xenophanes thus appears (like Pythagoras) mainly as a

      connected in the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
      that he at the same time struck out a new philosophical theory.
      His negation of theogony was tantamount to a negation of
      cosmogony. In substituting one God for many, he set aside all
      distinct agencies in the universe, to recognise only one agent,
      single, all-pervading, indivisible. He repudiated all genesis of a
      new reality, all actual existence of parts, succession, change,
      beginning, end, etc., in reference to the universe, as well as in
      reference to God. &#8220;Wherever I turned my mind (he exclaimed)
      everything resolved itself into One and the same: all things
      existing came back always and everywhere into one similar and

    <p>It was thus from Xenophanes that the doctrine of Pankosmism
      obtained introduction into Greek philosophy, recognising nothing
      real except the universe as an indivisible and unchangeable whole.
      Such a creed was altogether at variance with common perception,
      which apprehends the universe as a plurality of substances,
      distinguishable, divisible, changeable, &amp;c. And Xenophanes
      could not represent his One and All, which excluded all change, to
      be the substratum out of which phenomenal variety was generated &#8212;
      as Water, Air, the Infinite, had been represented by the Ionic
      philosophers. The sense of this contradiction, without knowing how
      to resolve it, appears to have occasioned the mournful complaints
      of irremediable doubt and uncertainty, preserved as fragments from
      his poems. &#8220;No man (he exclaims) knows clearly about the Gods or
      the universe: even if he speak what is perfectly true, he himself
      does not know it to be true: all is matter of opinion.&#8221;<a

    <p>Nevertheless while denying all real variety or division in the
      universe, Xenophanes did not deny the variety of human perceptions

      the universe &#8212; as subjective or relative, not as objective or
      absolute. He even promulgated opinions of his own respecting many

        remarkable for so early a period. Compare Herodotus (ii. 12) who
        notices the fact, and draws the same inference, as to Lower
        Egypt; also Plutarch, De Isid. et Osirid. c. 40, p. 367; and
        Strabo, i. p. 49-50, from whom we learn that the Lydian
        historian Xanthus had made the like observation, and also the
        like inference, for himself. Straton of Lampsakus, Eratosthenes,
        and Strabo himself, approved what Xanthus said.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_1_18"
          id="Sidenotev1_1_18"></a>Parmenides continues the doctrine of
        Xenophanes &#8212; Ens Parmenideum, self-existent, eternal,
        unchangeable, extended, &#8212; Non-Ens, an unmeaning phrase.</span></p>
    <p>Parmenides, of Elea, followed up and gave celebrity to the
      Xenophanean hypothesis in a poem, of which the striking exordium
      is yet preserved. The two veins of thought, which Xenophanes had
      recognised and lamented his inability to reconcile, were
      proclaimed by Parmenides as a sort of inherent contradiction in
      the human mind &#8212; Reason or Cogitation declaring one way, Sense
      (together with the remembrances and comparisons of sense)
      suggesting a faith altogether opposite. Dropping that controversy
      with the popular religion which had been raised by Xenophanes,
      Parmenides spoke of many different Gods or Goddesses, and insisted
      on the universe as one, without regarding it as one God. He
      distinguished Truth from matter of Opinion.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_58" href="#Footnotev1_1_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
      Truth was knowable only by pure mental contemplation or
      cogitation, the object of which was Ens or Being, the Real or
      Absolute: here the Cogitans and the Cogitatum were identical, one
      and the same.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_59" href="#Footnotev1_1_59"><span
          class="sp">59</span></a> Parmenides conceived Ens not simply
      as existent, but as <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page20"
          id="v1page20"></a>20</span> self-existent, without beginning
      or end,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_60" href="#Footnotev1_1_60"><span
          class="sp">60</span></a> as extended, continuous, indivisible,
      and unchangeable. The Ens Parmenideum comprised the two notions of
      Extension and Duration:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_61"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> it was
      something Enduring and Extended; Extension including both space,
      and matter so far forth as filling space. Neither the contrary of
      Ens (Non-Ens), nor anything intermediate between Ens and Non-Ens,
      could be conceived, or named, or reasoned about. Ens comprehended
      all that was Real, without beginning or end, without parts or
      difference, without motion or change, perfect and uniform like a
      well-turned sphere.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_62"

        Zeller (Die Philosophie der Griech., i. p. 403, ed. 2)
        maintains, in my opinion justly, that the Ens Parmenideum is
        conceived by its author as extended. Str&uuml;mpell (Geschichte
        der theor. Phil. der Griech., s. 44) represents it as
        unextended: but this view seems not reconcilable with the
        remaining fragments.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_1_19"></a>He recognises a region of opinion,
        phenomenal and relative, apart from Ens.</span> </p>
    <p>In this subject Ens, with its few predicates, chiefly negative,
      consisted all that Parmenides called Truth. Everything else
      belonged to the region of Opinion, which embraced all that was
      phenomenal, relative, and transient: all that involved a reference
      to man&#8217;s senses, apprehension, and appreciation, all the
      indefinite diversity of observed facts and inferences. Plurality,
      succession, change, motion, generation, destruction, division of
      parts, &amp;c., belonged to this category. Parmenides did not deny
      that he and other men had perceptions and beliefs corresponding to
      these terms, but he denied their application to the Ens or the
      self-existent. We are conscious of succession, but the
      self-existent has no succession: we perceive change of colour and
      other sensible qualities, and change of place or motion, but Ens
      neither changes nor moves. We talk of things generated or
      destroyed &#8212; things coming into being or going out of being &#8212; but
      this phrase can have no application to the self-existent Ens,
      which <i>is</i> always and cannot properly be called either past
      or future.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_63" href="#Footnotev1_1_63"><span
          class="sp">63</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page21" id="v1page21"></a>21</span> Nothing is really
      generated or destroyed, but only in appearance to us, or
      relatively to our apprehension.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_64"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> In like
      manner we perceive plurality of objects, and divide objects into
      parts. But Ens is essentially One, and cannot be divided.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_65" href="#Footnotev1_1_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
      Though you may divide a piece of matter you cannot divide the
      extension of which that matter forms part: you cannot (to use the
      expression of Hobbes<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_66"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>) pull
      asunder the first mile from the second, or the first hour from the
      second. The milestone, or the striking of the clock, serve as
      marks to assist you in making a mental division, and in
      considering or describing one hour and one mile apart from the
      next. This, however, is your own act, relative to yourself: there
      is no real division of extension into miles, or of duration into
      hours. You may consider the same space or time as one or as many,
      according to your convenience: as one hour or as sixty minutes, as
      one mile or eight furlongs. But all this is a process of your own
      mind and thoughts; another man may divide the same total in a way
      different from you. Your division noway modifies the reality
      without you, whatever that may be &#8212; the Extended and Enduring Ens
      &#8212; which remains still a continuous one, undivided and unchanged. </p>

        &#8220;To make parts, &#8212; or to part or divide, Space or Time, &#8212; is
        nothing else but to consider one and another within the same: so
        that if any man divide space or time, the diverse conceptions he
        has are more, by one, than the parts which he makes. For his
        first conception is of that which is to be divided &#8212; then, of
        some part of it &#8212; and again of some other part of it: and so
        forwards, as long as he goes in dividing. But it is to be noted,
        that here, by <i>division</i>, I do not mean the severing or
        pulling asunder of one space or time from another (for does any
        man think that one hemisphere may be separated from the other
        hemisphere, or the first hour from the second?), but <i>diversity



          of consideration</i>: so that division is not made by the
        operation of the hands, but of the mind.&#8221; &#8212; Hobbes, First
        Grounds of Philosophy, chap. vii. 5, vol. i. p. 96, ed.
        Molesworth. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Expansion and duration have this farther agreement, that
        though they are both considered by us as having parts, yet their
        parts are not separable one from another, not even in thought;
        though the parts of bodies from which we take our measure of the
        one &#8212; and the parts of motion, from which we may take the
        measure of the other &#8212; may be interrupted or separated.&#8221; &#8212;
        Locke, Essay on the Human Understanding, book ii. ch. 15. s. 11.
      </p>
      <p>In the Platonic Parmenides, p. 156 D., we find the remarkable
        conception of what he calls &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958;&#945;&#943;&#966;&#957;&#951;&#962;, &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; a

          id="Sidenotev1_1_20"></a>Parmenidean ontology stands
        completely apart from phenomenology.</span> </p>
    <p>The Ens of Parmenides thus coincided mainly with that which
      (since Kant) has been called the Noumenon &#8212; the Thing in itself &#8212;
      the Absolute; or rather with that which, by a frequent illusion,
      passes for the absolute &#8212; no notice being taken of the cogitant
      and believing apart from mind, as if cogitation and belief, <i>cogitata</i>
      and <i>credita</i>, would be had without it. By Ens was
      understood <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page22" id="v1page22"></a>22</span>
      the remnant in his mind, after leaving out all that abstraction,
      as far as it had then been carried, could leave out. It was the
      minimum indispensable to the continuance of thought; you cannot
      think (Parmenides says) without thinking of Something, and that
      Something Extended and Enduring. Though he and others talk of this
      Something as an Absolute (<i>i.e.</i> apart from or independent of
      his own thinking mind), yet he also uses some juster language (&#964;&#8056;
      &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;), showing that it is really
      relative: that if the Cogitans implies a Cogitatum, the Cogitatum
      also implies no less its correlative Cogitans: and that though we
      may divide the two in words, we cannot divide them in fact. It is
      to be remarked that Parmenides distinguishes the Enduring or
      Continuous from the Transient or Successive, Duration from
      Succession (both of which are included in the meaning of the word
      Time), and that he considers Duration alone as belonging to Ens or
      the Absolute &#8212; to the region of Truth &#8212; setting it in opposition
      or antithesis to Succession, which he treats as relative and
      phenomenal. We have thus (with the Eleates) the first appearance
      of Ontology, the science of Being or Ens, in Grecian philosophy.
      Ens is everything, and everything is Ens. In the view of
      Parmenides, Ontology is not merely narrow, but incapable of
      enlargement or application; we shall find Plato and others trying
      to expand it into numerous imposing generalities.<a

    <p>Apart from Ontology, Parmenides reckons all as belonging to human
      opinions. These were derived from the observations of sense (which
      he especially excludes from Ontology) with the comparisons,
      inferences, hypothesis, &amp;c., founded thereupon: the phenomena
      of Nature generally.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_68"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> He does

      or as a premiss from which the knowledge of nature is to be
      deduced. He treats the two &#8212; Ontology and Phenomenology, to employ
      an Hegelian word &#8212; as radically disparate, and incapable of any
      legitimate union. Ens was essentially one and enduring: Nature was
      essentially multiform, successive, ever changing and moving
      relative to the observer, and different to observers at different
      times and places. Parmenides approached the study of Nature from
      its own start<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page24"
          id="v1page24"></a>24</span>ing point, the same as had been
      adopted by the Ionic philosophers &#8212; the data of sense, or certain
      agencies selected among them, and vaguely applied to explain the
      rest. Here he felt that he relinquished the full conviction,
      inseparable from his intellectual consciousness, with which he
      announced his few absolute truths respecting Ens and Non-Ens, and
      that he entered upon a process of mingled observation and
      conjecture, where there was great room for diversity of views
      between man and man. </p>

        Karsten observes that the Parmenidean region of opinion
        comprised not merely the data of sense, but also the

        Marbach (Lehrbuch der Gesch. der Philos., s. 71, not. 3) after
        pointing out the rude philosophical expression of the
        Parmenidean verses, has some just remarks upon the double aspect
        of philosophy as there proclaimed, and upon the recognition by
        Parmenides of that which he calls the &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; vein of
        enquiry along with the &#8220;legitimate.&#8221; </p>
      <p>&#8220;Learn from me (says Parmenides) the opinions of mortals,
        brought to your ears in the deceitful arrangement of my words.
        This is not philosophy (Marbach says): it is Physics. We
        recognise in modern times two perfectly distinct ways of
        contemplating Nature: the philosophical and the physical. Of
        these two, the second dwells in plurality, the first in unity:
        the first teaches everything as infallible truth, the second as
        multiplicity of different opinions. We ought not to ask why
        Parmenides, while recognising the fallibility of this second
        road of enquiry, nevertheless undertook to march in it, &#8212; any
        more than we can ask, Why does not modern philosophy render
        physics superfluous?&#8221;</p>
      <p>The observation of Marbach is just and important, that the line
        of research which Parmenides treated as illegitimate and
        deceitful, but which he nevertheless entered upon, is the
        analogon of modern Physics. Parmenides (he says) indicated most
        truly the contrast and divergence between Ontology and Physics;
        but he ought to have gone farther, and shown how they could be
        reconciled and brought into harmony. This (Marbach affirms) was
        not even attempted, much less achieved, by Parmenides: but it
        was afterwards attempted by Plato, and achieved by Aristotle. </p>
      <p>Marbach is right in saying that the reconciliation was
        attempted by Plato; but he is not right (I think) in saying that
        it was achieved by Aristotle &#8212; nor by any one since Aristotle.
        It is the merit of Parmenides to have brought out the two points
        of view as radically distinct, and to have seen that the
        phenomenal world, if explained at all, must be explained upon
        general principles of its own, raised out of its own data of
        facts &#8212; not by means of an illusory Absolute and Real. The
        subsequent philosophers, in so far as they hid and slurred over
        this distinction, appear to me to have receded rather than
        advanced.</p>
    </div>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_1_22"
          id="Sidenotev1_1_22"></a>Parmenides recognises no truth, but

      Parmenides does not consider all opinions as equally true or
      equally untrue. He announces an opinion of his own &#8212; what he
      thinks most probable or least improbable &#8212; respecting the
      structure and constitution of the Kosmos, and he announces it
      without the least reference to his own doctrines about Ens. He
      promises information respecting Earth, Water, Air, and the
      heavenly bodies, and how they work, and how they came to be what
      they are.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_71" href="#Footnotev1_1_71"><span
          class="sp">71</span></a> He recognises two elementary
      principles or beginnings, one contrary to the other, but both of
      them positive &#8212; Light, comprehending the Hot, the Light, and the
      Rare &#8212; Darkness, comprehending the Cold, the Heavy, and the Dense.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_72" href="#Footnotev1_1_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
      These two elements, each endued with active and vital properties,
      were brought into junction and commixture by the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page25" id="v1page25"></a>25</span>
      influence of a Dea Genitalis analogous to Aphrodit&ecirc;,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_73" href="#Footnotev1_1_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
      with her first-born son Eros, a personage borrowed from the
      Hesiodic Theogony. From hence sprang the other active forces of
      nature, personified under various names, and the various
      concentric circles or spheres of the Kosmos. Of those spheres, the
      outer-most was a solid wall of fire &#8212; &#8220;flammantia m&#339;nia mundi&#8221; &#8212;
      next under this the &AElig;ther, distributed into several circles
      of fire unequally bright and pure &#8212; then the circle called the
      Milky Way, which he regarded as composed of light or fire combined
      with denser materials &#8212; then the Sun and Moon, which were
      condensations of fire from the Milky Way &#8212; lastly, the Earth,
      which he placed in the centre of the Kosmos.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_74" href="#Footnotev1_1_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a>
      He is said to have been the first who pronounced the earth to be
      spherical, and even distributed it into two or five zones.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_75" href="#Footnotev1_1_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a>
      He regarded it as immovable, in consequence of its exact position
      in the centre. He considered the stars to be fed by exhalation
      from the Earth. Midway between the Earth and the outer flaming
      circle, he supposed that there dwelt a Goddess &#8212; Justice or
      Necessity &#8212; who regulated all the movements of the Kosmos, and
      maintained harmony between its different parts. He represented the
      human <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page26" id="v1page26"></a>26</span>
      race as having been brought into existence by the power of the
      sun,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_76" href="#Footnotev1_1_76"><span
          class="sp">76</span></a> and he seems to have gone into some
      detail respecting animal procreation, especially in reference to
      the birth of male and female offspring. He supposed that the human
      mind, as well as the human body, was compounded of a mixture of
      the two elemental influences, diffused throughout all Nature: that
      like was perceived and known by like: that thought and sensation
      were alike dependent upon the body, and upon the proportions of
      its elemental composition: that a certain limited knowledge was
      possessed by every object in Nature, animate or inanimate.<a

        Aristotle (Metaphys. A. 5, p. 987, a. 1) represents Parmenides
        as assimilating one of his phenomenal principles (Heat) to Ens.
        and the other (Cold) to Non-Ens. There is nothing in the
        fragments of Parmenides to justify this supposed analogy. Heat
        as well as Cold belongs to Non-Ens, not to Ens, in the
        Parmenidean doctrine. Moreover Cold or Dense is just as much a
        positive principle as Hot or Rare, in the view of Parmenides; it
        is the female to the male (Parm. Fragm. v. 129; comp. Karsten,
        p. 270). Aristotle conceives Ontology as a substratum for
        Phenomenology; and his criticisms on Parmenides imply
        (erroneously in my judgment) that Parmenides did the same. The
        remarks which Brucker makes both on Aristotle&#8217;s criticism and on

        1152-3, about Xenophanes:&#8212;&#8220;Ex iis enim qu&aelig; apud
        Aristotelem ex ejus mente contra motum disputantur, patet
        Xenophanem mot&ucirc;s notionem aliam quam qu&aelig; in physicis
        obtinet, sibi concepisse; et ad verum motum progressum a nonente
        ad ens ejusque existentiam requisivisse. Quo sensu notionis
        hujus semel admisso, sequebatur (cum illud impossibile sit, ut
        ex nihilo fiat aliquid) universum esse immobile, adeoque et
        partes ejus non ita moveri, ut ex statu nihili procederent ad
        statum existenti&aelig;. Quibus admissis, de rerum tamen
        mutationibus disserere poterat, quas non alterationes,
        generationes, et extinctiones, rerum naturalium, sed
        modificationes, esse putabat: hoc nomine indignas, eo quod rerum
        universi natura semper maneret immutabilis, soliusque
        materi&aelig; &aelig;ternum fluentis particul&aelig; varie inter

        qu&icirc; de rebus physicis disserere et phenomena naturalia

        tamen de iis negat Aristoteles, <i>conceptum mot&ucirc;s

        and others ascribe to Parmenides the recognition not of five
        zones, but only of two. If it be true that Parmenides held this
        opinion about the figure of the earth, the fact is honourable to
        his acuteness; for Leukippus, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, Diogenes
        the Apolloniate, and Demokritus, all thought the earth to be a
        flat, round surface, like a dish or a drum: Plato speaks about
        it in so confused a manner that his opinion cannot be made out:
        and Aristotle was the first who both affirmed and proved it to
        be spherical. The opinion had been propounded by some
        philosophers earlier than Anaxagoras, who controverted it. See

    <p>Before we pass from Parmenides to his pupil and successor Zeno,
      who developed the negative and dialectic side of the Eleatic
      doctrine, it will be convenient to notice various other theories
      of the same century: first among them that of Herakleitus, who
      forms as it were the contrast and antithesis to Xenophanes and
      Parmenides. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_1_23"
          id="Sidenotev1_1_23"></a>Herakleitus &#8212; his obscure style,
        impressive metaphors, confident and contemptuous dogmatism. </span></p>
    <p>Herakleitus of Ephesus, known throughout antiquity by the
      denomination of the Obscure, comes certainly after Pythagoras and
      Xenophanes and apparently before Parmenides. Of the two first
      he made special mention, in one of the sentences, alike brief and
      contemptuous which have been preserved from his lost
      treatise:&#8212;&#8220;Much learning does not teach reason: otherwise it would
      have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hekat&aelig;us.&#8221;
      In another passage Herakleitus spoke of the &#8220;extensive knowledge,
      cleverness, and wicked arts&#8221; of Pythagoras. He declared that Homer
      as well as Archilochus deserved to be scourged and expelled from
      the public festivals.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_78"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> His
      thoughts were all embodied in one single treatise, which he is
      said to have deposited in the temple of the Ephesian Artemis. It
      was composed in a style most perplexing and difficult to
      understand, full of metaphor, symbolical illustration, and
      antithesis:<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page27" id="v1page27"></a>27</span>
      but this very circumstance imparted to it an air of poetical
      impressiveness and oracular profundity.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_79"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> It
      exercised a powerful influence on the speculative minds of Greece,
      both in the Platonic age, and subsequently: the Stoics especially
      both commented on it largely (though with many dissentient
      opinions among the commentators), and borrowed with partial
      modifications much of its doctrine.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_80"

        Diogen. Laert. ix. 1-6. Theophrastus conceived that Herakleitus
        had left the work unfinished, from eccentricity of temperament

        by some that his obscurity was intentional (Cicero, Nat. Deor.
        i. 26, 74, De Finib. 2, 5). The words of Lucretius about
        Herakleitus are remarkable (i. 641):&#8212; </p>

    <p>The expositors followed by Lucretius and Cicero conceived

        href="#Footnotev1_1_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a> as Thales
      had recognised water, and Anaximenes air. This interpretation was
      countenanced by some striking passages of Herakleitus: but when we
      put together all that remains from him, it appears that his main
      doctrine was not physical, but metaphysical or ontological: that
      the want of adequate general terms induced him to clothe it in a
      multitude of symbolical illustrations, among which fire was only
      one, though the most prominent and most significant.<a

      Xenophanes and the Eleates had recognised, as the only objective
      reality, One extended Substance or absolute Ens, perpetual,
      infinite, indeterminate, incapable of change or modification. They
      denied the objective reality of motion, change, generation, and
      destruction &#8212; considering all these to be purely relative and
      phenomenal. Herakleitus on the contrary denied <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page28" id="v1page28"></a>28</span>
      everything in the nature of a permanent and perpetual substratum:
      he laid down nothing as permanent and perpetual except the process
      of change &#8212; the alternate sequence of generation and destruction,
      without beginning or end &#8212; generation and destruction being in
      fact coincident or identical, two sides of the same process, since
      the generation of one particular state was the destruction of its
      antecedent contrary. All reality consisted in the succession and
      transition, the coming and going, of these finite and particular
      states: what he conceived as the infinite and universal, was the
      continuous process of transition from one finite state to the next
      &#8212; the perpetual work of destruction and generation combined, which
      terminated one finite state in order to make room for a new and
      contrary state. </p>

        Zeller&#8217;s account of the philosophy of Herakleitus in the second
        edition of his Philosophie der Griechen, vol. i. p. 450-496, is
        instructive. Marbach also is useful (Gesch. der Phil. s. 46-49);
        and his (Hegelian) exposition of Herakleitus is further
        developed by Ferdinand Lassalle (Die Philosophie Herakleitos des
        Dunklen, published 1858). This last work is very copious and

    <p>This endless process of transition, or ever-repeated act of
      generation and destruction in one, was represented by Herakleitus
      under a variety of metaphors and symbols &#8212; fire consuming its own
      fuel &#8212; a stream of water always flowing &#8212; opposite currents
      meeting and combating each other &#8212; the way from above downwards,
      and the way from below upwards, one and the same &#8212; war, contest,
      penal destiny or retributive justice, the law or decree of Zeus
      realising each finite condition of things and then destroying its
      own reality to make place for its contrary and successor.
      Particulars are successively generated and destroyed, none of them
      ever arriving at permanent existence:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_83"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> the
      universal process of generation and destruction alone continues.
      There is no Esse, but a perpetual Fieri: a transition from Esse to
      Non-Esse, from Non-Esse to Esse, with an intermediate temporary
      halt between them: a ceaseless meeting and confluence of the
      stream of generation with the opposite stream of destruction: a
      rapid and instant succession, or rather coincidence and

          id="Sidenotev1_1_26"></a>Nothing permanent except the law of
        process and implication of contraries &#8212; the transmutative force.
        Fixity of particulars is an illusion for most part, so far as it
        exists, it is a sin against the order of Nature.</span> </p>
    <p>The universal law, destiny, or divine working (according to
      Herakleitus), consists in this incessant process of generation and
      destruction, this alternation of contraries. To carry out such law
      fully, each of the particular manifestations ought to appear and
      pass away instantaneously &#8212; to have no duration of its own, but to
      be supplanted by its contrary at once. And this happens to a great
      degree, even in cases where it does not appear to happen: the
      river appears unchanged, though the water which we touched a short
      time ago has flowed away:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_85"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a> we and
      all around us are in rapid movement, though we appear stationary:
      the apparent sameness and fixity is thus a delusion. But
      Herakleitus does not seem to have thought that his absolute
      universal force was omnipotent, or accurately carried out in
      respect to all particulars. Some positive and particular
      manifestations, when once brought to pass, had a certain measure
      of fixity, maintaining themselves for more or less time before
      they were destroyed. There was a difference between one particular
      and another, in this respect of comparative durability: one was
      more durable, another less.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_86"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> But
      according to the universal law or destiny, each particular ought
      simply to make its appearance, then to be supplanted and
      re-absorbed; so that the time during which it continued on the
      scene was, as it were, an unjust usurpation, obtained by
      encroaching <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page30"
          id="v1page30"></a>30</span>on the equal right of the next
      comer, and by suspending the negative agency of the universal.
      Hence arises an antithesis or hostility between the universal law
      or process on one side, and the persistence of particular states
      on the other. The universal law or process is generative and
      destructive, positive and negative, both in one: but the
      particular realities in which it manifests itself are all
      positive, each succeeding to its antecedent, and each striving to
      maintain itself against the negativity or destructive interference
      of the universal process. Each particular reality represented rest
      and fixity: each held ground as long as it could against the
      pressure of the cosmical force, essentially moving, destroying,
      and renovating. Herakleitus condemns such pretensions of
      particular states to separate stability, inasmuch as it keeps back
      the legitimate action of the universal force, in the work of
      destruction and renovation. </p>

        symbolized his perpetual force, destroying and generating.</span>
    </p>
    <p>The theory of Herakleitus thus recognised no permanent
      substratum, or Ens, either material or immaterial &#8212; no category
      either of substance or quality &#8212; but only a ceaseless principle of
      movement or change, generation and destruction, position and
      negation, immediately succeeding, or coinciding with each other.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_87" href="#Footnotev1_1_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a>
      It is this principle or everlasting force which he denotes under
      so many illustrative phrases &#8212; &#8220;the common (&#964;&#8056; &#958;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#957;), <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page31" id="v1page31"></a>31</span>
      the universal, the all-comprehensive (&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#957;), the governing,
      the divine, the name or reason of Zeus, fire, the current of
      opposites, strife or war, destiny, justice, equitable measure,
      Time or the Succeeding,&#8221; &amp;c. The most emphatic way in which
      this theory could be presented was, as embodied, in the
      coincidence or co-affirmation of contraries. Many of the dicta
      cited and preserved out of Herakleitus are of this paradoxical
      tenor.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_88" href="#Footnotev1_1_88"><span
          class="sp">88</span></a> Other dicta simply affirm perpetual
      flow, change, or transition, without express allusion to
      contraries: which latter, however, though not expressed, must be
      understood, since change was conceived as a change from one
      contrary to the other.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_89"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> In the
      Herakleitean idea, contrary forces come simultaneously into
      action: destruction and generation always take effect together:
      there is no negative without a positive, nor positive without a
      negative.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_90" href="#Footnotev1_1_90"><span

        &#7960;&#966;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;. See the explanation given of this passage by Lassalle,
        vol. ii. p. 21, 39, 40, founded on the comment of Simplikius. He
        explains it as an universal law or ideal force &#8212; die reine Idee
        des Werdens selbst (p. 24), and &#8220;eine unsinnliche Potenz&#8221; (p.
        25). Yet, in i. p. 55 of his elaborate exposition, he does
        indeed say, about the theory of Herakleitus, &#8220;Hier sind zum
        erstenmale die sinnlichen Bestimmtheiten zu bloss verschiedenen
        und absolut in einander &uuml;bergehenden Formen eines
        identischen, ihnen zu Grunde liegenden, <i>Substrats</i>
        herabgesetzt&#8221;. But this last expression appears to me to
        contradict the whole tenor and peculiarity of Lassalle&#8217;s own
        explanation of the Herakleitean theory. He insists almost in
        every page (compare ii. p. 156) that &#8220;das Allgemeine&#8221; of
        Herakleitus is &#8220;reines Werden; reiner, steter, erzeugender,
        Prozess&#8221;. This process cannot with any propriety be called a <i>substratum</i>,
        and Herakleitus admitted no other. In thus rejecting any
        substratum he stood alone. Lassalle has been careful in showing
        that Fire was not understood by Herakleitus as a substratum (as
        water by Thales), but as a symbol for the universal force or
        law. In the theory of Herakleitus no substratum was recognised &#8212;
        no &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953; or &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#8212; in the same way as Aristotle observes

      <p>One of the metaphors by which Herakleitus illustrated his

        (Air) and Earth.</span> </p>
    <p>Such was the metaphysical or logical foundation of the philosophy
      of Herakleitus: the idea of an eternal process of change,
      manifesting itself in the perpetual destruction and renovation of
      particular realities, but having itself no reality apart from
      these particulars, and existing only in them as an immanent
      principle or condition. This principle, from the want of
      appropriate abstract terms, he expressed in a variety of
      symbolical and metaphorical <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page32" id="v1page32"></a>32</span> phrases, among
      which Fire stood prominent.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_91"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a> But
      though Fire was thus often used to denote the principle or ideal
      process itself, the same word was also employed to denote that one
      of the elements which formed the most immediate manifestation of
      the principle. In this latter sense, Fire was the first stage of
      incipient reality: the second stage was water, the third earth.
      This progression, fire, water, earth, was in Herakleitean language
      &#8220;the road downwards,&#8221; which was the same as &#8220;the road upwards,&#8221;
      from earth to water and again to fire. The death of fire was its
      transition into water: that of water was its transition partly
      into earth, partly into flame. As fire was the type of extreme
      mobility, perpetual generation and destruction &#8212; so earth was the
      type of fixed and stationary existence, resisting movement or
      change as much as possible.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_92"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> Water was
      intermediate between the two. </p>

        See a striking passage cited from Gregory of Nyssa by Lassalle
        (vol. i. p. 287), illustrating this characteristic of fire; the
        flame of a lamp appears to continue the same, but it is only a
        succession of flaming particles, each of which takes fire and is
        extinguished in the same instant: &#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#961;&#965;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#962;

    <p>Herakleitus conceived the sun and stars, not as solid bodies, but
      as meteoric aggregations perpetually dissipated and perpetually
      renewed or fed, by exhalation upward from the water and earth. The
      sun became extinguished and rekindled in suitable measure and
      proportion, under the watch of the Erinnyes, the satellites of
      Justice. These celestial lights were contained in troughs, the
      open side of which was turned towards our vision. In case of
      eclipses the trough was for the time reversed, so that the dark
      side was turned towards us; and the different phases of the moon
      were occasioned by the gradual turning round of the trough in
      which <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page33" id="v1page33"></a>33</span>
      her light was contained. Of the phenomena of thunder and lightning
      also, Herakleitus offered some explanation, referring them to
      aggregations and conflagrations of the clouds, and violent
      currents of winds.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_93"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a> Another
      hypothesis was often ascribed to Herakleitus, and was really
      embraced by several of the Stoics in later times &#8212; that there
      would come a time when all existing things would be destroyed by
      fire (&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#973;&#961;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;), and afterwards again brought into reality in a
      fresh series of changes. But this hypothesis appears to have been
      conceived by him metaphysically rather than physically. Fire was
      not intended to designate the physical process of combustion, but
      was a symbolical phrase for the universal process; the perpetual
      agency of conjoint destruction and renovation, manifesting itself
      in the putting forth and re-absorption of particulars, and having
      no other reality except as immanent in these particulars.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_94" href="#Footnotev1_1_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a>
      The determinate Kosmos of the present moment is perpetually
      destroyed, passing into fire or the indeterminate: it is
      perpetually renovated or passes out of fire into water, earth &#8212;
      out of the indeterminate, into the various determinate
      modifications. At the same time, though Herakleitus seems to have
      mainly employed these symbols for the purpose of signifying or
      typifying a metaphysical conception, yet there was no clear
      apprehension, even in his own mind, of this generality, apart from

    <p>The like blending of metaphysics and physics &#8212; of the abstract
      and the concrete and sensible &#8212; is to be found in the statements
      remaining from Herakleitus respecting the human soul and human
      knowledge. The human soul, according to him, was an effluence or
      outlying portion of the Universal<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_96"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> &#8212; the
      fire &#8212; the perpetual movement or life of things. As such, its
      nature was to be ever in movement: but it was imprisoned and
      obstructed by the body, which represented the stationary, the
      fixed, the particular &#8212; that which resisted the universal force of
      change. So long as a man lived, his soul or mind, though thus
      confined, participated more or less in the universal movement: but
      when he died, his body ceased to participate in it, and became
      therefore vile, &#8220;fit only to be cast out like dung&#8221;. Every man,
      individually considered, was irrational;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_97"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> reason
      belonged only to the universal or the whole, with which the mind
      of each living man was in conjunction, renewing itself by
      perpetual absorption, inspiration or inhalation, vaporous
      transition, impressions through the senses and the pores, &amp;c.
      During sleep, since all the media of communication, except only
      those through respiration, were suspended, the mind became
      stupefied and destitute of memory. Like coals when the fire is
      withdrawn, it lost its heat and tended towards extinction.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_98" href="#Footnotev1_1_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a>
      On waking, it recovered its full communication with the great
      source of intelligence without &#8212; the universal all-comprehensive
      process of life and movement. Still, though this was <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page35" id="v1page35"></a>35</span>
      the one and only source of intelligence open to all waking men,
      the greater number of men could neither discern it for themselves,
      nor understand it without difficulty even when pointed out to
      them. Though awake, they were not less unconscious or forgetful of
      the process going on around them, than if they had been asleep.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_99" href="#Footnotev1_1_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a>

      false information.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_100"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a> They
      went wrong by following their own individual impression or
      judgment: they lived as if reason or intelligence belonged to each
      man individually. But the only way to attain truth was, to abjure
      all separate reason, and to follow the common or universal reason.
      Each man&#8217;s mind must become identified and familiar with that
      common process which directed and transformed the whole: in so far
      as he did this, he attained truth: whenever he followed any
      private or separate judgment of his own, he fell into error.<a

      <p>The Stoics, who took up the doctrine of Herakleitus with
        farther abstraction and analysis, distinguished and named
        separately matters which he conceived in one and named together
        &#8212; the physical inhalation of air &#8212; the metaphysical supposed

        seems to denote, not any distinct or fixed local region, but the
        rotatory movement or circulation of the elements, fire, water,
        earth, reverting back into each other. Lassalle, vol. ii. p.

    <p>By this denunciation of the mischief of private judgment,
      Herakleitus did not mean to say that a man ought to think like his
      neighbours or like the public. In his view the public were wrong,
      collectively as well as <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page36"
          id="v1page36"></a>36</span> individually. The universal reason
      to which he made appeal, was not the reason of most men as it
      actually is but that which, in his theory, ought to be their
      reason:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_103" href="#Footnotev1_1_103"><span
          class="sp">103</span></a> that which formed the perpetual and
      governing process throughout all nature, though most men neither
      recognised nor attended to it, but turned away from it in
      different directions equally wrong. No man was truly possessed of
      reason, unless his individual mind understood the general scheme
      of the universe, and moved in full sympathy with its perpetual
      movement and alternation or unity of contraries.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_104" href="#Footnotev1_1_104"><span
          class="sp">104</span></a> The universal process contained in
      itself a sum-total of particular contraries which were
      successively produced and destroyed: to know the universal was to
      know these contraries in one, and to recognise them as transient,
      but correlative and inseparable, manifestations, each implying the
      other &#8212; not as having each a separate reality and each excluding
      its contrary.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_105" href="#Footnotev1_1_105"><span

      universal, he acquired true knowledge; but the individualising
      influences arising from the body usually overpowered this kindred
      with the universal, and obstructed the continuity of this
      movement, so that most persons became plunged in error and
      illusion. </p>

        The analogy and sympathy between the individual mind and the

      current of the universal. The Real, on this theory, was a

      revolutions, destructions, generations, &amp;c., determined by a
      law of justice or necessity which endured, and which alone
      endured, for ever. Herakleitus had many followers, who adopted his

      It suggested many doubts and debates respecting the foundations of
      logical evidence, and the distinction of truth from falsehood;

        stands averred in modern physical philosophy. Mr. Grove
        observes, in his instructive Treatise on the Correlation of
        Physical Forces, p. 22: </p>
      <p>&#8220;Of absolute rest, Nature gives us no evidence. All matter, as
        far as we can discern, is ever in movement: not merely in
        masses, as in the planetary spheres, but also molecularly, or
        throughout its intimate structure. Thus every alteration of
        temperature produces a molecular change throughout the whole
        substance heated or cooled: slow chemical or electrical forces,
        actions of light or invisible radiant forces, are always at
        play; so that, as a fact, we cannot predicate of any portion of
        matter, that it is absolutely at rest.&#8221;</p>
    </div>

        Many references to Herakleitus are found in the recently
        published books of the Refutatio H&aelig;resium by Pseudo-Origen
        or Hippolytus &#8212; especially Book ix. p. 279-283, ed. Miller. To
        judge by various specimens there given, it would appear that his
        juxta-positions of contradictory predicates, with the same
        subject, would be recognised as paradoxes merely in appearance,
        and not in reality, if we had his own explanation. Thus he says
        (p. 282) &#8220;the pure and the corrupt, the drinkable and the
        undrinkable, are one and the same.&#8221; Which is explained as
        follows: &#8220;The sea is most pure and most corrupt: to fish, it is
        drinkable and nutritive; to men, it is undrinkable and
        destructive.&#8221; This explanation appears to have been given by
        Herakleitus himself, &#952;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#945;, <span class="gesp">&#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x1F76;&#x3BD;</span>,
        &amp;c. </p>
      <p>These are only paradoxes in appearance &#8212; the relative predicate
        being affirmed without mention of its correlate. When you supply
        the correlate to each predicate, there remains no contradiction
        at all.</p>

        elements, and two moving or restraining forces.</span> </p>
    <p>After Herakleitus, and seemingly at the same time with <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page38" id="v1page38"></a>38</span>Parmenides,



      we arrive at Empedokles (about 500-430 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>)
      and his memorable doctrine of the Four Elements. This philosopher,
      a Sicilian of Agrigentum, and a distinguished as well as
      popular-minded citizen, expounded his views in poems, of which
      Lucretius<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_108" href="#Footnotev1_1_108"><span
          class="sp">108</span></a> speaks with high admiration, but of
      which few fragments are preserved. He agreed with Parmenides, and
      dissented from Herakleitus and the Ionic philosophers, in
      rejecting all real generation and destruction.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_109" href="#Footnotev1_1_109"><span
          class="sp">109</span></a> That which existed had not been
      generated and could not be destroyed. Empedokles explained what
      that was, which men mistook for generation and destruction. There
      existed four distinct elements &#8212; Earth, Water, Air, and Fire &#8212;
      eternal, inexhaustible, simple, homogeneous, equal, and
      co-ordinate with each other. Besides these four substances, there
      also existed two moving forces, one contrary to the other &#8212; Love
      or Friendship, which brought the elements into conjunction &#8212;
      Enmity or Contest, which separated them. Here were alternate and
      conflicting agencies, either bringing together different portions
      of the elements to form a new product, or breaking up the product
      thus formed and separating the constituent elements. Sometimes the
      Many were combined into One; sometimes the One was decomposed into
      Many. Generation was simply this combination of elements already
      existing separately &#8212; not the calling into existence of anything
      new: destruction was in like manner the dissolution of some
      compound, not the termination of any existent simple substance.
      The four simple substances or elements (which Empedokles sometimes
      calls by names of the popular Deities &#8212; Zeus, H&ecirc;r&ecirc;,
      Aidoneus, &amp;c.), were the roots or foundations of everything.<a

      was predominant, sometimes the other, sometimes there was
      equilibrium between them. Things accordingly pass through a
      perpetual and ever-renewed cycle. The complete preponderance of
      Love brings alternately all the elements into close and compact
      unity, Enmity being for the time eliminated. Presently the action
      of the latter recommences, and a period ensues in which Love and
      Enmity are simultaneously operative; until at length Enmity
      becomes the temporary master, and all union is for the time
      dissolved. But this condition of things does not last. Love again
      becomes active, so that partial and increasing combination of the
      elements is produced, and another period commences &#8212; the
      simultaneous action of the two forces, which ends in renewed

      &#8212; constancy only in the general principle of combination and
      dissolution. The Kosmos which Empedokles undertakes to explain,
      takes its commencement from the period of complete empire of Love,
      or compact and undisturbed union of all the elements. This he
      conceives and divinises under the name of Sph&aelig;rus &#8212; as One
      sphere, harmonious, uniform, and universal, having no motion,
      admitting no parts or separate existences within it, exhibiting <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page40" id="v1page40"></a>40</span>no
      one of the four elements distinctly, &#8220;instabilis tellus, innabilis
      unda&#8221; &#8212; a sort of chaos.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_113"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a> At the
      time prescribed by Fate or Necessity, the action of Enmity
      recommenced, penetrating gradually through the interior of
      Sph&aelig;rus, &#8220;agitating the members of the God one after
      another,&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_114" href="#Footnotev1_1_114"><span
          class="sp">114</span></a> disjoining the parts from each
      other, and distending the compact ball into a vast porous mass.
      This mass, under the simultaneous and conflicting influences of
      Love and Enmity, became distributed partly into homogeneous
      portions, where each of the four elements was accumulated by
      itself &#8212; partly into compounds or individual substances, where two
      or more elements were found in conjunction. Like had an appetite
      for Like &#8212; Air for Air, Fire for Fire, and so forth: and a farther
      extension of this appetite brought about the mixture of different
      elements in harmonious compounds. First, the Air disengaged
      itself, and occupied a position surrounding the central mass of
      Earth and Water: next, the Fire also broke forth, and placed
      itself externally to the Air, immediately in contact with the
      outermost crystalline sphere, formed of condensed and frozen air,
      which formed the wall encompassing the Kosmos. A remnant of Fire
      and Air still remained embodied in the Earth, but the great mass
      of both so distributed themselves, that the former occupied most
      part of one hemisphere, the latter most part of the other.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_115" href="#Footnotev1_1_115"><span
          class="sp">115</span></a> The rapid and uniform rotation of
      the Kosmos, caused by the exterior<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page41" id="v1page41"></a>41</span> Fire, compressed
      the interior elements, squeezed the water out of the earth like
      perspiration from the living body, and thus formed the sea. The
      same rotation caused the earth to remain unmoved, by
      counterbalancing and resisting its downward pressure or gravity.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_116" href="#Footnotev1_1_116"><span
          class="sp">116</span></a> In the course of the rotation, the
      light hemisphere of Fire, and the comparatively dark hemisphere of
      Air, alternately came above the horizon: hence the interchange of
      day and night. Empedokles (like the Pythagoreans) supposed the sun
      to be not self-luminous, but to be a glassy or crystalline body
      which collected and reflected the light from the hemisphere of
      Fire. He regarded the fixed stars as fastened to the exterior
      crystalline sphere, and revolving along with it, but the planets
      as moving free and detached from any sphere.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_117" href="#Footnotev1_1_117"><span
          class="sp">117</span></a> He supposed the alternations of
      winter and summer to arise from a change in the proportions of Air
      and Fire in the atmospheric regions: winter was caused by an
      increase of the Air, both in volume and density, so as to drive
      back the exterior Fire to a greater distance from the Earth, and
      thus to produce a diminution of heat and light: summer was
      restored when the Fire, in its turn increasing, extruded a portion
      of the Air, approached nearer to the Earth, and imparted to the
      latter more heat and light.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_118"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_118"><span class="sp">118</span></a>
      Empedokles farther supposed (and his contemporaries, Anaxagoras
      and Diogenes, held the same opinion) that the Earth was round and
      flat at top and bottom, like a drum or tambourine: that its
      surface had been originally horizontal, in reference to the
      rotation of the Kosmos around it, but that it had afterwards
      tilted down to the south and upward towards the north, so as to
      lie aslant instead of horizontal. Hence he explained the fact that
      the north pole of the heavens now appeared obliquely elevated
      above the horizon.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_119"

      <p>The condition of things which Empedokles calls Sph&aelig;rus
        may be illustrated (translating his Love and Enmity into the
        modern phraseology of <i>attraction</i> and <i>repulsion</i>)
        from an eminent modern work on Physics:&#8212; &#8220;Were there only atoms
        and attraction, as now explained, the whole material of creation
        would rush into close contact, and the universe would be one
        huge solid mass of stillness and death. There is heat or
        caloric, however, which directly counteracts attraction and
        singularly modifies the results. It has been described by some
        as a most subtile fluid pervading things, as water does a
        sponge: others have accounted it merely a vibration among the
        atoms. The truth is, that we know little more of heat as a cause
        of repulsion, than of gravity as a cause of attraction: but we
        can study and classify the phenomena of both most accurately.&#8221;

      its tenants, and its furniture; how men were first produced, and
      how put together. All were produced by the Earth: being thrown up
      under the stimulus of Fire still remaining within it. In its
      earliest manifestations, and before the influence of Discord had
      been sufficiently neutralized, the Earth gave birth to plants
      only, being as yet incompetent to produce animals.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_121" href="#Footnotev1_1_121"><span
          class="sp">121</span></a> After a certain time she gradually
      acquired power to produce animals, first imperfectly and
      piecemeal, trunks without limbs and limbs without trunks; next,
      discordant and monstrous combinations, which did not last, such as
      creatures half man half ox; lastly, combinations with parts suited
      to each other, organizations perfect and durable, men, horses,
      &amp;c., which continued and propagated.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_122"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_122"><span class="sp">122</span></a> Among
      these productions were not only plants, birds, fishes, and men,
      but also the &#8220;long-lived Gods&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_123"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a> All
      compounds were formed by intermixture of the four elements, in

        name="FnAnchorv1_1_124" href="#Footnotev1_1_124"><span
          class="sp">124</span></a> These elements remained unchanged:
      no one of them was transformed into another. But the small
      particles of each flowed into the pores of the others, and the
      combination was more or less intimate, according as the structure
      of these pores was more or less adapted to receive them. So
      intimate did the mixture of these fine particles become, when the
      effluvia of one and the pores of another were in symmetry, that
      the constituent ingredients, like colours compounded together by
      the painter,<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_125" href="#Footnotev1_1_125"><span

        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page43" id="v1page43"></a>43</span>or
      handled separately. Empedokles rarely assigned any specific ratio
      in which he supposed the four elements to enter into each distinct
      compound, except in the case of flesh and blood, which were formed
      of all the four in equal portions; and of bones, which he affirmed
      to be composed of one-fourth earth, one-fourth water, and the
      other half fire. He insisted merely on the general fact of such
      combinations, as explaining what passed for generation of new
      substances without pointing out any reason to determine one ratio
      of combination rather than another, and without ascribing to each
      compound a distinct ratio of its own. This omission in his system
      is much animadverted on by Aristotle. </p>

      <p>Galen says, however (after Aristot. Gen. et Corr. ii. 7, p.
        334, a. 30), that this mixture, set forth by Empedokles, is not
        mixture properly speaking, but merely close proximity.
        Hippokrates (he says) was the first who propounded the doctrine
        of real mixture. But Empedokles seems to have intended a real
        mixture, in all cases where the structure of the pores was in
        symmetry with the inflowing particles. Oil and water (he said)
        would not mix together, because there was no such symmetry
        between them &#8212; &#8005;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150; (Empedokles) &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#943;&#958;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8135;

        Procreation &#8212; Respiration &#8212; movement of the blood.</span> </p>
    <p>Empedokles farther laid down many doctrines respecting
      physiology. He dwelt on the procreation of men and animals,
      entered upon many details respecting gestation and the f&#339;tus, and
      even tried to explain what it was that determined the birth of
      male or female offspring. About respiration, alimentation, and
      sensation, he also proposed theories: his explanation of
      respiration remains in one of the fragments. He supposed that man
      breathed, partly through the nose, mouth, and lungs, but partly
      also through the whole surface of the body, by the pores wherewith
      it was pierced, and by the internal vessels connected with those
      pores. Those internal vessels were connected with the blood
      vessels, and the portion of them near the surface was alternately
      filled with blood or emptied of blood, by the flow outwards from
      the centre or the ebb inwards towards the centre. Such was the
      movement which Empedokles considered as constantly belonging to
      the blood: alternately a projection outwards from the centre and a
      recession backwards towards the centre. When the blood thus
      receded, the extremities of the vessels were <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page44" id="v1page44"></a>44</span>left



      empty, and the air from without entered: when the outward tide of
      blood returned, the air which had thus entered was expelled.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_126" href="#Footnotev1_1_126"><span
          class="sp">126</span></a> Empedokles conceived this outward
      tide of blood to be occasioned by the effort of the internal fire
      to escape and join its analogous element without.<a

      <p>The comments of Aristotle on this theory of Empedokles are
        hardly pertinent: they refer to respiration by the nostrils,
        which was not what Empedokles had in view (Aristot. De Respirat.
        c. 3).</p>

      <p>Empedokles illustrates this influx and efflux of air in
        respiration by the klepsydra, a vessel with one high and narrow
        neck, but with a broad bottom pierced with many small holes.
        When the neck was kept closed by the finger or otherwise, the
        vessel might be plunged into water, but no water would ascend
        into it through the holes in the bottom, because of the
        resistance of the air within. As soon as the neck was freed from
        pressure, and the air within allowed to escape, the water would
        immediately rush up through the holes in the bottom. </p>
      <p>This illustration is interesting. It shows that Empedokles was
        distinctly aware of the pressure of the air as countervailing
        the ascending movement of the water, and the removal of that
        pressure as allowing such movement. Vers. 286:&#8212;</p>

        explanation of perceptions &#8212; Intercommunication of the elements
        with the sentient subject &#8212; like acting upon like. </span></p>
    <p>The doctrine of pores and effluvia, which formed so conspicuous
      an item in the physics of Empedokles, was applied by him to
      explain sensation. He maintained the general doctrine (which
      Parmenides had advanced before him, and which Plato retained after
      him), that sensation was produced by like acting upon like:
      Herakleitus before him, and Anaxagoras after him, held that it was
      produced by unlike acting upon unlike. Empedokles tried (what
      Parmenides had not tried) to apply his doctrine to the various
      senses separately.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_128"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> Man was
      composed of the same four elements as the universe around him: and
      since like always tended towards like, so by each of the four
      elements within himself, he perceived and knew the like element
      without. Effluvia from all bodies entered his pores, wherever they
      found a suitable channel: hence he perceived and knew earth by
      earth, water by water, and so forth.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_129"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a>
      Empedokles, assuming perception and knowledge to be produced by
      such intercommunication of the four elements, believed that not
      man <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page45" id="v1page45"></a>45</span>and



      animals only, but plants and other substances besides, perceived
      and knew in the same way. Everything possessed a certain measure
      of knowledge, though less in degree, than man, who was a more
      compound structure.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_130"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a>
      Perception and knowledge was more developed in different animals
      in proportion as their elementary composition was more mixed and
      varied. The blood, as the most compound portion of the whole body,
      was the principal seat of intelligence.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_131"

      <p>Theophrastus, in commenting upon the doctrine of Empedokles,
        takes as one of his grounds of objection &#8212; That Empedokles, in
        maintaining sensation and knowledge to be produced by influx of
        the elements into pores, made no difference between animated and
        inanimate substances (Theophr. De Sens. s. 12-23). Theophrastus
        puts this as if it were an inconsistency or oversight of
        Empedokles: but it cannot be so considered, for Empedokles (as
        well as Parmenides) appears to have accepted the consequence,
        and to have denied all such difference, except one of degree, as
        to perception and knowledge.</p>

    <p>In regard to vision, Empedokles supposed that it was operated
      mainly by the fire or light within the eye, though aided by the
      light without. The interior of the eye was of fire and water, the
      exterior coat was a thin layer of earth and air. Colours were
      brought to the eye as effluvia from objects, and became
      apprehended as sensations by passing into the alternate pores or
      ducts of fire and water: white colour was fitted to (or in

      water.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_132" href="#Footnotev1_1_132"><span

      located, than others: in some, the fire was in excess, or too much
      on the outside, so as to obstruct the pores or ducts of water: in
      others, water was in excess, and fire in defect. The latter were
      the<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page46" id="v1page46"></a>46</span>
      animals which saw better by day than by night, a great force of
      external light being required to help out the deficiency of light
      within: the former class of animals saw better by night, because,
      when there was little light without, the watery ducts were less
      completely obstructed &#8212; or left more free to receive the influx of
      black colour suited to them.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_133"

    <p>In regard to hearing, Empedokles said that the ear was like a
      bell or trumpet set in motion by the air without; through which
      motion the solid parts were brought into shock against the air
      flowing in, and caused the sensation of sound within.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_134" href="#Footnotev1_1_134"><span
          class="sp">134</span></a> Smell was, in his view, an adjunct
      of the respiratory process: persons of acute smell were those who
      had the strongest breathing: olfactory effluvia came from many
      bodies, and especially from such as were light and thin.
      Respecting taste and touch, he gave no further explanation than
      his general doctrine of effluvia and pores: he seems to have
      thought that such interpenetration was intelligible by itself,
      since here was immediate and actual contact. Generally, in respect
      to all the senses, he laid it down that pleasure ensued when the
      matter which flows in was not merely fitted in point of structure
      to penetrate the interior pores or ducts (which was the condition
      of all sensation), but also harmonious with them in respect to
      elementary mixture.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_135"

        Theophrast. De Sensu, s. 9, 10. The criticisms of Theophrastus
        upon this theory of Empedokles are extremely interesting, as
        illustrating the change in the Grecian physiological point of
        view during a century and a half, but I reserve them until I
        come to the Aristotelian age. I may remark, however, that
        Theophrastus, disputing the doctrine of sensory effluvia
        generally, disputes the existence of the olfactory effluvia not
        less than the rest (s. 20).</p>

    <p>Empedokles held various opinions in common with the Pythagoreans
      and the brotherhood of the Orphic mysteries &#8212; especially that of
      the metempsychosis. He represented himself as having passed
      through prior states of existence, as a boy, a girl, a shrub, a
      bird, and a fish. He proclaims it as an obligation of justice,
      absolute and universal, not to kill anything that had life: he
      denounces as an abomination the sacrificing of or eating of an
      animal, in whom perhaps might dwell <span class="pagenum"><a

      religious faith, however, and his opinions about Gods,
      D&aelig;mons, and the human soul, stood apart (mostly in a
      different poem) from his doctrines on kosmology and physiology. In
      common with many Pythagoreans, he laid great stress on the
      existence of D&aelig;mons (of intermediate order and power between
      Gods and men), some of whom had been expelled from the Gods in
      consequence of their crimes, and were condemned to pass a long
      period of exile, as souls embodied in various men or animals. He
      laments the misery of the human soul, in himself as well as in
      others, condemned to this long period of expiatory degradation,
      before they could regain the society of the Gods.<a

      he announces himself almost as a God upon earth, and professes his
      willingness as well as ability to impart to a favoured pupil the
      most wonderful gifts &#8212; powers to excite or abate the winds, to
      bring about rain or dry weather, to raise men from the dead.<a

    <p>Anaxagoras of Klazomen&aelig;, a friend of the Athenian Perikles,
      and contemporary of Empedokles, was a man of far simpler and less
      ambitious character: devoted to physical contemplation and
      geometry, without any of those mystical pretentions common among
      the Pythagoreans. His doctrines were set forth in prose, and in
      the Ionic dialect.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_141"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a> His
      theory, like all those of his age, was all-comprehensive in its
      purpose, starting from a supposed beginning, and shewing how
      heaven, earth, and the inhabitants of earth, had come into those
      appearances which were exhibited to sense. He agreed with
      Empedokles in departing from the point of view of Thales and other
      Ionic theorists, who had supposed one primordial matter, out of
      which, by various transformations, other sensible things were
      generated &#8212; and into which, when destroyed, they were again
      resolved. Like Empedokles, and like Parmenides previously, he
      declared that generation, understood in this sense, was a false
      and impossible notion: that no existing thing could have been
      generated, or could be destroyed, or could undergo real
      transformation into any other thing different from what it was.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_142" href="#Footnotev1_1_142"><span
          class="sp">142</span></a> Existing things were what they were,
      possessing their several inherent properties: there could be no
      generation except the putting together of these things in various
      compounds, nor any destruction except the breaking up of such
      compounds, nor any transformation except the substitution of one
      compound for another. </p>

      <p>Lucretius calls this theory Hom&#339;omeria, and it appears to me
        that this name must have been bestowed upon it by its author.
        Zeller and several others, after Schleiermacher, conceive the
        name to date first from Aristotle and his physiological
        classification. But what other name was so natural or likely for
        Anaxagoras himself to choose?</p>
    </div>
    <p>But while Anaxagoras held that each of these Hom&#339;omeries<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_145" href="#Footnotev1_1_145"><span
          class="sp">145</span></a> was a special sort of matter with
      its own properties, and each of them unlike every other: he held
      farther the peculiar doctrine, that no one of them could have an
      existence apart from the rest. Everything was mixed with
      everything: each included in itself all the others: not one of
      them could be obtained pure and unmixed. This was true of any
      portion however small. The visible and tangible bodies around us
      affected our senses, and received their denominations according to
      that one peculiar matter of which they possessed a decided
      preponderance and prominence. But each of them included in itself
      all the other matters, real and inseparable, although latent.<a

        primordial varieties of matter were huddled together in
        confusion. Nous, or Reason, distinct from all of them,
        supervened and acted upon this confused mass, setting the
        constituent particles in movement. </span></p>
    <p>In the beginning (said Anaxagoras) all things (all sorts <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page50" id="v1page50"></a>50</span>of
      matter) were together, in one mass or mixture. Infinitely numerous
      and infinite in diversity of magnitude, they were so packed and
      confounded together that no one could be distinguished from the
      rest: no definite figure, or colour, or other property, could
      manifest itself. Nothing was distinguishable except the infinite
      mass of Air and &AElig;ther (Fire), which surrounded the mixed
      mass and kept it together.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_147"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_147"><span class="sp">147</span></a> Thus
      all things continued for an infinite time in a state of rest and
      nullity. The fundamental contraries &#8212; wet, dry, hot, cold, light,
      dark, dense, rare, &#8212; in their intimate contact neutralised each
      other.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_148" href="#Footnotev1_1_148"><span
          class="sp">148</span></a> Upon this inert mass supervened the
      agency of Nous or Mind. The characteristic virtue of mind was,
      that it alone was completely distinct, peculiar, pure in itself,
      unmixed with anything else: thus marked out from all other things
      which were indissolubly mingled with each other. Having no
      communion of nature with other things, it was noway acted upon by
      them, but was its own master or autocratic, and was of very great
      force. It was moreover the thinnest and purest of all things;
      possessing complete knowledge respecting all other things. It was
      like to itself throughout &#8212; the greater manifestations of mind
      similar to the less.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_149"

      which were compounds wherein many of the numerous ingredients
      present were equally effective, so that the manifestations were
      more confused and complicated. In this way the four Empedoklean
      elements formed a vast seed-magazine, out of which many distinct
      developments might take place, of ingredients all pre-existing

        Aristotle, in two places (De C&#339;lo, iii. 3, p. 302, a. 28, and
        Gen. et Corr. i. 1, p. 314, a. 18) appears to state that
        Anaxagoras regarded flesh and bone as simple and elementary:
        air, fire, and earth, as compounds from these and other
        Hom&#339;omeries. So Zeller (Philos. d. Griech., v. i. p. 670, ed.
        2), with Ritter, and others, understand him. Schaubach (Anax.
        Fr. p. 81, 82) dissents from this opinion, but does not give a
        clear explanation. Another passage of Aristotle (Metaphys. A. 3,
        p. 984, a. 11) appears to contradict the above two passages, and
        to put fire and water, in the Anaxagorean theory, in the same
        general category as flesh and bone: the explanatory note of
        Bonitz, who tries to show that the passage in the Metaphysica is
        in harmony with the other two above named passages, seems to me
        not satisfactory. </p>
      <p>Lucretius (i. 835, referred to in a previous <a
          href="#Footnotev1_1_144">note</a>) numbers flesh, bone, fire,
        and water, all among the Anaxagorean Hom&#339;omeries; and I cannot
        but think that Aristotle, in contrasting Anaxagoras with
        Empedokles, has ascribed to the former language which could only
        have been used by the latter. &#7960;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#966;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#959;&#7985;

      <p>Now it can hardly be said that Anaxagoras recognised one set of
        bodies as simple and elementary, and that Empedokles recognised
        another set of bodies as such. Anaxagoras expressly denied <i>all



          simple bodies</i>. In his theory, all bodies were compound: <i>Nous</i>
        alone formed an exception. Everything existed in everything. But
        they were compounds in which particles of one sort, or of a
        definite number of sorts, had come together into such positive
        and marked action, as practically to nullify the remainder. The
        generation of the Hom&#339;omeric aggregate was by disengaging these
        like particles from the confused mixture in which their agency
        had before lain buried (&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#7956;&#954;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#954;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166;

        Hom&#339;omeric aggregates or bodies were infinite in number: for
        ingredients might be disengaged and recombined in countless
        ways, so that the result should always be some positive and
        definite manifestations. Considered in reference to the
        Hom&#339;omeric body, the constituent particles might in a certain
        sense be called elements.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_1_48"></a>Theory of Anaxagoras compared with
        that of Empedokles. </span></p>
    <p>In comparing the theory of Anaxagoras with that of Empedokles, we
      perceive that both of them denied not only the generation of new
      matter out of nothing (in <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page53" id="v1page53"></a>53</span>which denial all
      the ancient physical philosophers concurred), but also the
      transformation of one form of matter into others, which had been
      affirmed by Thales and others. Both of them laid down as a basis
      the existence of matter in a variety of primordial forms. They
      maintained that what others called generation or transformation,
      was only a combination or separation of these pre-existing
      materials, in great diversity of ratios. Of such primordial forms
      of matter Empedokles recognised only four, the so-called Elements;
      each simple and radically distinct from the others, and capable of
      existing apart from them, though capable also of being combined
      with them. Anaxagoras recognised primordial forms of matter in
      indefinite number, with an infinite or indefinite stock of
      particles of each; but no one form of matter (except Nous) capable
      of being entirely severed from the remainder. In the constitution
      of every individual body in nature, particles of all the different
      forms were combined; but some one or a few forms were preponderant
      and manifest, all the others overlaid and latent. Herein consisted
      the difference between one body and another. The Hom&#339;omeric body
      was one in which a confluence of like particles had taken place so
      numerous and powerful, as to submerge all the coexistent particles
      of other sorts. The majority thus passed for the whole, the
      various minorities not being allowed to manifest themselves, yet
      not for that reason ceasing to exist: a type of human society as
      usually constituted, wherein some one vein of sentiment, ethical,
      &aelig;sthetical, religious, political, &amp;c., acquires such
      omnipotence as to impose silence on dissentients, who are supposed
      not to exist because they cannot proclaim themselves without ruin.

    <p>The hypothesis of multifarious forms of matter, latent yet still

      negative and stationary Chaos. The Nous or Mind is the Agency
      selected for this purpose by Anaxagoras: Love and Enmity by
      Empedokles. Both the one and the other initiate the rotatory

        href="#Footnotev1_1_159"><span class="sp">159</span></a>) as the
      cause of all that was good in the world, assigning other agencies
      as the causes of all evil. It is not characterised by him as a

      are, or will be; but it effects this only by acting as a
      fermenting principle, to break up the huddled mass, and to
      initiate rotatory motion, at first only on a small scale, then
      gradually increasing. Rotation having once begun, and the mass
      having been as it were unpacked and liberated the component
      Hom&#339;omeries are represented as coming together by their own

        href="#Footnotev1_1_161"><span class="sp">161</span></a> The
      Anaxagorean Nous introduces order and symmetry into Nature, simply
      by stirring up rotatory motion in the inert mass, so as to release
      the Hom&#339;omeries from prison. It originates and maintains the great
      cosmical fact of rotatory motion; which variety of motion, from
      its perfect regularity and sameness, is declared by Plato also to
      be the one most consonant to Reason and Intelligence.<a

      only <i>knows</i> these phenomena as and when they occur.
      Anaxagoras tried to explain them as well as he could; not by
      reference to final causes, nor by assuming good purposes of Nous
      which each combination was intended to answer &#8212; but by physical
      analogies, well or ill chosen, and especially by the working of

        for deserting his own theory.</span> </p>
    <p>This we learn from Plato and Aristotle, who blame Anaxagoras for
      inconsistency in deserting his own hypothesis, and in invoking
      explanations from physical agencies, to the neglect of Nous and
      its supposed optimising purposes. But Anaxagoras, as far as we can
      judge by his remaining fragments, seems not to have committed any
      such inconsistency. He did not proclaim his Nous to be a powerful
      extra-cosmical Architect, like the Demiurgus of Plato &#8212; nor an
      intra-cosmical, immanent, undeliberating instinct (such as
      Aristotle calls Nature), tending towards the production and
      renewal of regular forms and conjunctions, yet operating along
      with other agencies which produced concomitants irregular,
      unpredictable, often even obstructive and monstrous. Anaxagoras
      appears to conceive his Nous as one among numerous other real
      agents in Nature, material like the rest, yet differing from the
      rest as being powerful, simple, and pure from all mixture,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_164" href="#Footnotev1_1_164"><span
          class="sp">164</span></a> as being endued with universal
      cognizance, as being the earliest to act in point of time, and as
      furnishing the primary condition to the activity of the rest by
      setting on foot the cosmical rotation. The Hom&#339;omeries are
      coeternal with, if not anterior to, Nous. They have laws and
      properties of their own, which they follow, when once liberated,
      without waiting for the dictation of Nous. What they do is known

      </span></p>
    <p>In describing the formation of the Kosmos, Anaxagoras supposed
      that, as a consequence of the rotation initiated by mind, the
      primitive chaos broke up. &#8220;The Dense, Wet, Cold, Dark, Heavy, came
      together into the place where now Earth is: Hot, Dry, Bare, Light,
      Bright, departed to the exterior region of the revolving
      &AElig;ther.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_167" href="#Footnotev1_1_167"><span
          class="sp">167</span></a> In such separation each followed its
      spontaneous and inherent tendency. Water was disengaged from air
      and clouds, earth from water: earth was still farther consolidated
      into stones by cold.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_168"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_168"><span class="sp">168</span></a> Earth
      remained stationary in the centre, while fire and air were borne
      round it by the force and violence of the rotatory movement. The
      celestial bodies &#8212; Sun, Moon, and Stars &#8212; were solid bodies
      analogous to the earth, either caught originally in the whirl of
      the rotatory movement, or torn from the substance of the earth and
      carried away into the outer region of rotation.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_169" href="#Footnotev1_1_169"><span
          class="sp">169</span></a> They were rendered hot and luminous
      by the fiery fluid in the rapid whirl of which they were hurried
      along. The Sun was a stone thus made red-hot, larger than
      Peloponnesus: the Moon was of earthy matter, nearer to the Earth,
      deriving its light from the Sun, and including not merely plains
      and mountains, but also cities and inhabitants.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_170" href="#Footnotev1_1_170"><span
          class="sp">170</span></a> Of the planetary movements, apart
      from the diurnal rotation of the celestial sphere, Anaxagoras took
      no notice.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_171" href="#Footnotev1_1_171"><span
          class="sp">171</span></a> He explained the periodical changes
      in the apparent course of the sun and moon by resistances which
      they encountered, the former from accumulated and condensed air,
      the latter from the cold.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_172"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_172"><span class="sp">172</span></a> Like
      Anaximenes and Demokritus, Anaxagoras conceived the Earth as flat,
      round in the surface, and not deep, resting on and supported by
      the air beneath it. Originally (he thought) the earth was
      horizontal, with the axis of celestial rotation perpendicular, and
      the north pole at the zenith, so that <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page58" id="v1page58"></a>58</span>this rotation was
      then lateral, like that of a dome or roof; it was moreover equable
      and unchanging with reference to every part of the plane of the
      earth&#8217;s upper surface, and distributed light and heat equally to
      every part. But after a certain time the Earth tilted over of its
      own accord to the south, thus lowering its southern half, raising
      the northern half, and causing the celestial rotation to appear
      oblique.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_173" href="#Footnotev1_1_173"><span

    <p>Besides these doctrines respecting the great cosmical bodies,
      Anaxagoras gave explanations of many among the striking phenomena

      hurricanes, hail, snow, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_174"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_174"><span class="sp">174</span></a> He

        href="#Footnotev1_1_175"><span class="sp">175</span></a> He
      thought that animals were originally produced by the hot and moist
      earth; but that being once produced, the breeds were continued by
      propagation. The seeds of plants he supposed to have been
      originally contained in the air, from whence they fell down to the
      warm and moist earth, where they took root and sprung up.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_176" href="#Footnotev1_1_176"><span
          class="sp">176</span></a> He believed that all plants, as well
      as all animals, had a certain measure of intelligence and
      sentiment, differing not in kind but only in degree from the
      intelligence and sentiment of men; whose superiority of
      intelligence was determined, to a great extent, by their
      possession of hands.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_177"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_177"><span class="sp">177</span></a> He
      explained sensation by the action of unlike upon unlike (contrary

      to be sadly obscure and insufficient as means of knowledge.
      Apparently, however, he did not discard their testimony, nor
      assume any other means of knowledge independent of it, but
      supposed a concomitant and controlling effect of intelligence as
      indispensable to compare and judge between the facts of sense when
      they appeared contradictory.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_179"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_179"><span class="sp">179</span></a> On this

      <p>Among the points to which Anaxagoras addressed himself was the
        annual inundation of the Nile, which he ascribed to the melting
        of the snows in &AElig;thiopia, in the higher regions of the
        river&#8217;s course. &#8212; Diodor. i. 38. Herodotus notices this opinion

      <p>This difference followed naturally from the opinions of the two
        philosophers on the nature of the soul or mind. Anaxagoras
        supposed it peculiar in itself, and dissimilar to the
        Hom&#339;omeries without. Empedokles conceived it as a compound of
        the four elements, analogous to all that was without: hence man

        Anaxag. Fr. 19, Schaub.; Sextus Empiric. adv. Mathem. vii.
        91-140; Cicero, Academ. i. 12. </p>
      <p>Anaxagoras remarked that the contrast between black and white
        might be made imperceptible to sense by a succession of numerous
        intermediate colours very finely graduated. He is said to have
        affirmed that snow was really black, notwithstanding that it
        appeared white to our senses: since water was black, and snow
        was only frozen water (Cicero, Academ. iv. 31; Sext. Empir.
        Pyrrhon. Hypotyp. i. 33). &#8220;Anaxagoras non modo id ita esse (<i>sc.</i>
        albam nivem esse) negabat, sed sibi, quia sciret aquam nigram
        esse, unde illa concreta esset, albam ipsam esse <i>ne videri
          quidem</i>.&#8221; Whether Anaxagoras ever affirmed that snow did
        not <i>appear to him</i> white, may reasonably be doubted: his
        real affirmation probably was, that snow, though it appeared
        white, was not really white. And this affirmation depended upon
        the line which he drew between the fact of sense, the
        phenomenal, the relative, on one side &#8212; and the substratum, the
        real, the absolute, on the other. Most philosophers recognise a
        distinction between the two; but the line between the two has
        been drawn in very different directions. Anaxagoras assumed as
        his substratum, real, or absolute, the Hom&#339;omeries &#8212; numerous
        primordial varieties of matter, each with its inherent
        qualities. Among these varieties he reckoned <i>water</i>, but
        he did not reckon <i>snow</i>. He also considered that water
        was really and absolutely black or dark (the Homeric &#956;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#957; &#8021;&#948;&#969;&#961;)
        &#8212; that blackness was among its primary qualities. Water, when
        consolidated into snow, was so disguised as to produce upon the
        spectator the appearance of whiteness; but it did not really
        lose, nor could it lose, its inherent colour. A negro covered
        with white paint, and therefore looking white, is still really
        black: a wheel painted with the seven prismatic colours, and
        made to revolve rapidly, will look white, but it is still really
        septi-coloured: <i>i.e.</i> the state of rapid revolution would
        be considered as an exceptional state, not natural to it.

      substitute scientific theories in place of the personal agency of
      the Gods, were repugnant to the religious feelings of the Greeks,
      has been already remarked.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_181"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_181"><span class="sp">181</span></a> Yet
      most of the other contemporary philosophers must have been open to
      this reproach, not less than Anaxagoras; and we learn that the
      Apolloniate Diogenes left Athens from the same cause. If others
      escaped the like prosecution which fell upon Anaxagoras, we may
      probably ascribe this fact to the state of political party at
      Athens, and to the intimacy of the latter with Perikles. The
      numerous political enemies of that great man might fairly hope to
      discredit him in the public mind &#8212; at the very least to vex and
      embarrass him &#8212; by procuring the trial and condemnation of
      Anaxagoras. Against other philosophers, even when propounding
      doctrines not less obnoxious respecting the celestial bodies,
      there was not the same collateral motive to stimulate the
      aggressive hostility of individuals. </p>

    <p>Contemporary with Anaxagoras &#8212; yet somewhat younger, as far as we
      can judge, upon doubtful evidence &#8212; lived the philosopher
      Diogenes, a native of Apollonia in Krete. Of his life we know
      nothing except that he taught during some time at Athens, which
      city he was forced to quit on the same ground as Anaxagoras.
      Accusations of impiety were either brought or threatened against
      him:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_182" href="#Footnotev1_1_182"><span

        Diogen. Laert. ix. 52. The danger incurred by Diogenes the
        Apolloniate at Athens is well authenticated, on the evidence of
        Demetrius the Phalerean, who had good means of knowing. And the
        fact may probably be referred to some time after the year <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> 440, when Athens was at the height
        of her power and of her attraction for foreign visitors &#8212; when
        the visits of philosophers to the city had been multiplied by
        the countenance of Perikles &#8212; and when the political rivals of
        that great man had set the fashion of assailing them in order to
        injure him. This seems to me one probable reason for determining
        the chronology of the Apolloniate Diogenes: another is, that his
        description of the veins in the human body is so minute and
        detailed as to betoken an advanced period of philosophy between
        <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 440-410. See the point discussed
        in Panzerbieter, Fragment. Diogen. Apoll. c. 12-18 (Leipsic,
        1830). </p>
      <p>Simplikius (ad Aristot. Phys. fol. 6 A) describes Diogenes as
        having been &#963;&#967;&#949;&#948;&#8056;&#957; &#957;&#949;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; in the series of physical theorists.</p>

    <p>Diogenes the Apolloniate, the latest in the series of Ionic
      philosophers or physiologists, adopted, with modifications and
      enlargements, the fundamental tenet of Anaximenes. There <span

      but one primordial element &#8212; and that element was air. He laid it
      down as indisputable that all the different objects in this Kosmos
      must be at the bottom one and the same thing: unless this were the
      fact, they would not act upon each other, nor mix together, nor do
      good and harm to each other, as we see that they do. Plants would
      not grow out of the earth, nor would animals live and grow by
      nutrition, unless there existed as a basis this universal sameness
      of nature. No one thing therefore has a peculiar nature of its
      own: there is in all the same nature, but very changeable and
      diversified.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_183" href="#Footnotev1_1_183"><span

    <p>Now the fundamental substance, common to all, was air. Air was
      infinite, eternal, powerful; it was, besides, full of intelligence
      and knowledge. This latter property Diogenes proved by the
      succession of climatic and atmospheric phenomena of winter and
      summer, night and day, rain, wind, and fine weather. All these
      successions were disposed in the best possible manner by the air:
      which could not have laid out things in such regular order and
      measure, unless it had been endowed with intelligence. Moreover,
      air was the source of life, soul, and intelligence, to men and
      animals: who inhaled all these by respiration, and lost all of
      them as soon as they ceased to respire.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_184"

    <p>Air, life-giving and intelligent, existed everywhere, formed the
      essence of everything, comprehended and governed everything.
      Nothing in nature could be without it: yet at the same time all
      things in nature partook of it <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page62" id="v1page62"></a>62</span>in a different
      manner.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_185" href="#Footnotev1_1_185"><span
          class="sp">185</span></a> For it was distinguished by great
      diversity of properties and by many gradations of intelligence. It
      was hotter or colder &#8212; moister or drier &#8212; denser or rarer &#8212; more
      or less active and movable &#8212; exhibiting differences of colour and
      taste. All these diversities were found in objects, though all at
      the bottom were air. Reason and intelligence resided in the warm
      air. So also to all animals as well as to men, the common source
      of vitality, whereby they lived, saw, heard, and understood, was
      air; hotter than the atmosphere generally, though much colder than
      that near the sun.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_186"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_186"><span class="sp">186</span></a>
      Nevertheless, in spite of this common characteristic, the air was
      in other respects so indefinitely modifiable, that animals were of
      all degrees of diversity, in form, habits, and intelligence. Men
      were doubtless more alike among themselves: yet no two of them
      could be found exactly alike, furnished with the same dose of
      aerial heat or vitality. All other things, animate and inanimate,
      were generated and perished, beginning from air and ending in air:
      which alone continued immortal and indestructible.<a

      concentrated round the brain, and reached by veins from the organs
      of sense, was the centre of sensation. Taste was explained by the
      soft and porous nature of the tongue, and by the number of veins
      communicating with it. The juices of sapid bodies were sucked up
      by it as by a sponge: the odorous stream of air penetrated from
      without through the nostrils: both were thus brought into
      conjunction with the sympathising cerebral air. To this air also
      the image impressed upon the eye was transmitted, thereby causing
      vision:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_190" href="#Footnotev1_1_190"><span
          class="sp">190</span></a> while pulsations and vibrations of
      the air without, entering through the ears and impinging upon the
      same centre, generated the sensation of sound. If the veins
      connecting the eye with the brain were inflamed, no visual
      sensation could take place;<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_191"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_191"><span class="sp">191</span></a>
      moreover if our minds or attention were absorbed in other things,
      we were often altogether insensible to sensations either of sight
      or of sound: which proved that the central air within us was the
      real seat of sensation.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_192"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_192"><span class="sp">192</span></a> Thought
      and intelligence, as well as sensation, was an attribute of the
      same central air within us, depending especially upon its purity,
      dryness, and heat, and impeded or deadened by moisture or cold.
      Both children and animals had less intelligence than men: because
      they had more moisture in their bodies, so that the veins were
      choked up, and the air could not get along them freely to all
      parts. Plants had no intelligence; having no apertures or ducts
      whereby the air could pervade their internal structure. Our
      sensations were pleasurable when there was much air mingled with
      the blood, so as to lighten the flow of it, and to carry it easily
      to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page64" id="v1page64"></a>64</span>all



      parts: they were painful when there was little air, and when the
      blood was torpid and thick.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_193"

    <p>The structure of the Kosmos Diogenes supposed to have been
      effected by portions of the infinite air, taking upon them new
      qualities and undergoing various transformations. Some air,
      becoming cold, dense, and heavy, sunk down to the centre, and
      there remained stationary as earth and water: while the hotter,
      rarer, and lighter air ascended and formed the heavens, assuming
      through the intelligence included in it a rapid rotatory movement
      round the earth, and shaping itself into sun, moon, and stars,
      which were light and porous bodies like pumice stone. The heat of
      this celestial matter acted continually upon the earth and water
      beneath, so that the earth became comparatively drier, and the
      water was more and more drawn up as vapour, to serve for
      nourishment to the heavenly bodies. The stars also acted as
      breathing-holes to the Kosmos, supplying the heated celestial mass
      with fresh air from the infinite mass without.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_194" href="#Footnotev1_1_194"><span
          class="sp">194</span></a> Like Anaxagoras, Diogenes conceived
      the figure of the earth as flat and round, like a drum; and the
      rotation of the heavens as lateral, with the axis perpendicular to
      the surface of the earth, and the north pole always at the zenith.
      This he supposed to have been the original arrangement; but after
      a certain time, the earth tilted over spontaneously towards the
      south &#8212; the northern half was elevated and the southern half
      depressed &#8212; so that the north pole was no longer at the zenith,
      and the axis of rotation of the<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page65" id="v1page65"></a>65</span> heavens became
      apparently oblique.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_195"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_195"><span class="sp">195</span></a> He
      thought, moreover, that the existing Kosmos was only of temporary
      duration; that it would perish and be succeeded by future
      analogous systems, generated from the same common substance of the
      infinite and indestructible air.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_196"

        theory. </span></p>
    <p>Nearly contemporary with Anaxagoras and Empedokles, two other
      enquirers propounded a new physical theory very different from
      those already noticed &#8212; usually known under the name of the atomic
      theory. This Atomic theory, though originating with the Eleate
      Leukippus, obtained celebrity chiefly from his pupil Demokritus of
      Abdera, its expositor and improver. Demokritus (born seemingly in
      <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 460, and reported to have reached
      extreme old age) was nine years younger than Sokrates,
      thirty-three years older than Plato, and forty years younger than
      Anaxagoras.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_198" href="#Footnotev1_1_198"><span
          class="sp">198</span></a> The age of Leukippus is not known,
      but he can hardly have been much younger than Anaxagoras. </p>

        Apollodorus as to the date of his birth, appears more
        trustworthy than the earlier date assigned by Thrasyllus (<span

    <p>Of Leukippus we know nothing: of Demokritus, very little &#8212; yet
      enough to exhibit a life, like that of Anaxagoras, consecrated to
      philosophical investigation, and neglectful not merely of
      politics, but even of inherited patrimony.<a

      towards the study of Nature, with conceptions less vague, and a
      more enlarged observation of facts, than any of his contemporaries
      had ever bestowed. He was enabled to boast that no one had
      surpassed him in extent of travelling over foreign lands, in
      intelligent research and converse with enlightened natives, or in
      following out the geometrical relations <span class="pagenum"><a

      many different subjects, including ethics, as well as physics,
      astronomy, and anthropology. None of them have been preserved. But
      we read, even from critics like Dionysius of Halikarnassus and
      Cicero, that they were composed in an impressive and semi-poetical

      <p>Diogenes (ix. 46-48) enumerates the titles of the treatises of
        Demokritus, as edited in the days of Tiberius by the rhetor
        Thrasyllus: who distributed them into tetralogies, as he also
        distributed the dialogues of Plato. It was probably the charm of
        style, common to Demokritus with Plato, which induced the rhetor
        thus to edit them both. In regard to scope and spirit of
        philosophy, the difference between the two was so marked, that
        Plato is said to have had a positive antipathy to the works of
        Demokritus, and a desire to burn them (Aristoxenus ap. Diog.
        Laert. ix. 40). It could hardly be from congeniality of doctrine
        that the same editor attached himself to both. It has been
        remarked that Plato never once names Demokritus, while Aristotle
        cites him very frequently, sometimes with marked praise.</p>

    <p>The theory of Leukippus and Demokritus (we have no means of

          class="sp">202</span></a> Parmenides the Eleate (as I have
      already stated) in distinguishing Ens, the self-existent, real, or
      absolute, on one side &#8212; from the phenomenal and relative on the
      other &#8212; conceived the former in such a way that its connection
      with the latter was dissolved. The real and absolute, according to
      him, was One, extended, enduring, continuous, unchangeable,
      immovable: the conception of Ens included these affirmations, and
      at the same time excluded peremptorily Non-Ens, or the contrary of
      Ens. Now the plural, unextended, transient, discontinuous,
      changeable, and moving, implied a mixture of Ens and Non-Ens, or a
      partial transition from one to the other. Hence (since Non-Ens was
      inadmissible) such plurality, &amp;c., could not belong to the
      real or absolute (ultra-phenomenal), and could only be affirmed as
      phenomenal or relative. In the latter sense, Parmenides <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page67" id="v1page67"></a>67</span><i>did</i>
      affirm it, and even tried to explain it: he explained the
      phenomenal facts from phenomenal assumptions, apart from and
      independent of the absolute. While thus breaking down the bridge
      between the phenomenal on one side and the absolute on the other,
      he nevertheless recognised each in a sphere of its own. </p>

        and Vacua &#8212; Ens and Non-Ens. </span></p>
    <p>This bridge the atomists undertook to re-establish. They admitted
      that Ens could not really change &#8212; that there could be no real
      generation, or destruction &#8212; no transformation of qualities &#8212; no
      transition of many into one, or of one into many. But they denied
      the unity and continuity and immobility of Ens: they affirmed that
      it was essentially discontinuous, plural, and moving. They
      distinguished the extended, which Parmenides had treated as an <i>Unum



        continuum</i>, into extension with body, and extension without
      body: into <i>plenum</i> and <i>vacuum</i>, matter and space.
      They conceived themselves to have thus found positive meanings
      both for Ens and Non-Ens. That which Parmenides called Non-Ens or
      nothing, was in their judgment the <i>vacuum</i>; not less
      self-existent than that which he called Something. They
      established their point by showing that Ens, thus interpreted,
      would become reconcilable to the phenomena of sense: which latter
      they assumed as their basis to start from. Assuming motion as a
      phenomenal fact, obvious and incontestable, they asserted that it
      could not even appear to be a fact, without supposing <i>vacuum</i>
      as well as body to be real: and the proof that both of them were
      real was, that only in this manner could sense and reason be
      reconciled. Farther, they proved the existence of a <i>vacuum</i>
      by appeal to direct physical observation, which showed that bodies
      were porous, compressible, and capable of receiving into
      themselves new matter in the way of nutrition. Instead of the
      Parmenidean Ens, one and continuous, we have a Demokritean Ens,
      essentially many and discontinuous: <i>plena</i> and <i>vacua</i>,
      spaces full and spaces empty, being infinitely intermingled.<a

      vacant space within it, and therefore indivisible as well as
      indestructible: but each severed from the rest by surrounding
      vacant space. The atom could undergo no change: but by means of
      the empty space around, it could freely move. Each atom was too
      small to be visible: yet all atoms were not equally small; there
      were fundamental differences between them in figure and magnitude:
      and they had no other qualities except figure and magnitude. As no
      atom could be divided into two, so no two atoms could merge into
      one. Yet though two or more atoms could not so merge together as
      to lose their real separate individuality, they might nevertheless
      come into such close approximation as to appear one, and to act on
      our senses as a phenomenal combination manifesting itself by new
      sensible properties.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_204"

      <p>The affirmation of Demokritus &#8212; That Nothing existed, just as
        much as Something &#8212; appears a paradox which we must probably
        understand as implying that he here adopted, for the sake of
        argument, the language of the Eleates, his opponents. They
        called the vacuum <i>Nothing</i>, but Demokritus did not so
        call it. If (said Demokritus) you call vacuum <i>Nothing</i>,
        then I say that Nothing exists as well as Something. </p>
      <p>The direct observations by which Demokritus showed the
        existence of a vacuum were &#8212; 1. A vessel with ashes in it will
        hold as much water as if it were empty: hence we know that there
        are pores in the ashes, into which the water is received. 2.
        Wine can be compressed in skins. 3. The growth of organised
        bodies proves that they have pores, through which new matter in
        the form of nourishment is admitted. (Aristot. Physic. iv. 6, p.
        213, b.) </p>
      <p>Besides this, Demokritus set forth motion as an indisputable
        fact, ascertained by the evidence of sense: and affirmed that
        motion was impossible, except on the assumption that vacuum
        existed. Melissus, the disciple of Parmenides, inverted the
        reasoning, in arguing against the reality of motion. If it be
        real (he said), then there must exist a vacuum: but no vacuum
        does or can exist: therefore there is no real motion. (Aristot.
        Physic. iv. 6.) </p>
      <p>Since Demokritus started from these facts of sense, as the base
        of his hypothesis of atoms and vacua, so Aristotle (Gen. et
        Corr. i. 2; De Anim&acirc;, i. 2) might reasonably say that he
        took sensible appearances as truth. But we find Demokritus also
        describing reason as an improvement and enlightenment of sense,
        and complaining how little of truth was discoverable by man. See
        Mullach, Demokritus (pp. 414, 415). Compare Philippson &#8212; &#8031;&#955;&#951;

    <p>The bridge, broken down by Parmenides, between the real and the
      phenomenal world, was thus in theory re-established. <span

      the real world, as described by Demokritus, differed entirely from
      the sameness and barrenness of the Parmenidean Ens, and presented
      sufficient movement and variety to supply a basis of explanatory
      hypothesis, accommodated to more or less of the varieties in the
      phenomenal world. In respect of quality, indeed, all the atoms
      were alike, not less than all the vacua: such likeness was
      (according to Demokritus) the condition of their being able to act
      upon each other, or to combine as phenomenal aggregates.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_205" href="#Footnotev1_1_205"><span
          class="sp">205</span></a> But in respect to quantity or
      magnitude as well as in respect to figure, they differed very
      greatly: moreover, besides all these diversities, the ordination
      and position of each atom with regard to the rest were variable in
      every way. As all objects of sense were atomic compounds, so, from
      such fundamental differences &#8212; partly in the constituent atoms
      themselves, partly in the manner of their arrangement when thrown
      into combination &#8212; arose all the diverse qualities and
      manifestations of the compounds. When atoms passed into new
      combination, then there was generation of a new substance: when
      they passed out of an old combination there was destruction: when
      the atoms remained the same, but were merely arranged anew in
      order and relative position, then the phenomenon was simply
      change. Hence all qualities and manifestations of such compounds
      were not original, but derivative: they had no &#8220;nature of their
      own,&#8221; or law peculiar to them, but followed from the atomic
      composition of the body to which they belonged. They were not real
      and absolute, like the magnitude and figure of the constituent
      atoms, but phenomenal and relative &#8212; <i>i.e.</i> they were powers
      of acting upon correlative organs of sentient beings, and
      nullities in the absence of such organs.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_206"

      cold, &amp;c., of the bodies around us: they were relative,
      implying correlative percipients. Moreover they were not merely
      relative, but perpetually fluctuating; since the compounds were
      frequently changing either in arrangement or in diversity of
      atoms, and every such atomic change, even to a small extent,
      caused it to work differently upon our organs.<a

        different qualities in the compounds. </span></p>
    <p>Among the various properties of bodies, however, there were two
      which Demokritus recognised as not merely relative to the
      observer, but also as absolute and belonging to the body in
      itself. These were weight and hardness &#8212; primary qualities (to use
      the phraseology of Locke and Reid), as contrasted with the
      secondary qualities of colour, taste, and the like. Weight, or
      tendency downward, belonged (according to Demokritus) to each
      individual atom separately, in proportion to its magnitude: the
      specific gravity of all atoms was supposed to be equal. In
      compound bodies one body was heavier than another, in proportion
      as its bulk was more filled with atoms and less with vacant space.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_208" href="#Footnotev1_1_208"><span
          class="sp">208</span></a> The hardness and softness of bodies
      Demokritus explained by the peculiar size and peculiar junction of
      their component atoms. Thus, comparing lead with iron, the former
      is heavier and softer, the latter is lighter and harder. Bulk for
      bulk, the lead contained a larger proportion of solid, and a
      smaller proportion of interstices, than the iron: hence it was
      heavier. But its structure was equable throughout; it had a
      greater multitude of minute atoms diffused through its bulk,
      equally close to and coherent with each other on every side, but
      not more close and coherent on one side than on another. The
      structure of the iron, on the contrary, was unequal and irregular,
      including larger <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page71"
          id="v1page71"></a>71</span>spaces of vacuum in one part, and
      closer approach of its atoms in other parts: moreover these atoms
      were in themselves larger, hence there was a greater force of
      cohesion between them on one particular side, rendering the whole
      mass harder and more unyielding than the lead.<a

    <p>We thus see that Demokritus, though he supposed single atoms to
      be all of the same specific gravity, yet recognised a different
      specific gravity in the various compounds of atoms or material
      masses. It is to be remembered that, when we speak of contact or
      combination of atoms, this is not to be understood literally and
      absolutely, but only in a phenomenal and relative sense; as an
      approximation, more or less close, but always sufficiently close
      to form an atomic combination which our senses apprehended as one
      object. Still every atom was essentially separate from every
      other, and surrounded by a margin of vacant space: no two atoms
      could merge into one, any more than one atom could be divided into
      two. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_1_68"
          id="Sidenotev1_1_68"></a>All properties of objects, except
        weight and hardness, were phenomenal and relative to the
        observer. Sensation could give no knowledge of the real and
        absolute. </span></p>
    <p>Pursuant to this theory, Demokritus proclaimed that all the
      properties of objects, except weight, hardness, and softness, were
      not inherent in the objects themselves, but simply phenomenal and
      relative to the observer &#8212; &#8220;modifications of our sensibility&#8221;.
      Colour, taste, smell, sweet and bitter, hot and cold, &amp;c.,
      were of this description. In respect to all of them, man differed
      from other animals, one man from another, and even the same man
      from himself at different times and ages. There was no sameness of
      impression, no unanimity or constancy of judgment, because there
      was no real or objective &#8220;nature&#8221; corresponding to the impression.
      From none of these senses could we at all learn what the external
      thing was in itself. &#8220;Sweet and bitter, hot and cold (he said) are
      by law or convention (<i>i.e.</i> these names designate the
      impressions of most men on most occasions, taking no account of
      dissentients): what really exists is, atoms and vacuum. The
      sensible objects which we suppose and believe to exist do not
      exist in truth; there exist only atoms and vacuum. <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page72" id="v1page72"></a>72</span>We
      know nothing really and truly about an object, either what it is
      or what it is not: our opinions depend upon influences from
      without, upon the position of our body, upon the contact and
      resistances of external objects. There are two phases of
      knowledge, the obscure and the genuine. To the obscure belong all
      our senses &#8212; sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The genuine is
      distinct from these. When the obscure phase fails, when we can no
      longer see, nor hear, nor smell, nor taste, nor touch &#8212; from
      minuteness and subtlety of particles &#8212; then the genuine phase, or
      reason and intelligence, comes into operation.&#8221;<a

    <p>True knowledge (in the opinion of Demokritus) was hardly at all
      attainable; but in so far as it could be attained, we must seek
      it, not merely through the obscure and insufficient avenues of
      sense, but by reason or intelligence penetrating to the ultimatum
      of corpuscular structure, farther than sense could go. His atoms
      were not pure Abstracta (like Plato&#8217;s Ideas and geometrical plane
      figures, and Aristotle&#8217;s materia prima), but concrete bodies, each
      with its own<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_211" href="#Footnotev1_1_211"><span
          class="sp">211</span></a> magnitude, figure, and movement; too
      small to be seen or felt by us, yet not too small to be seen or
      felt by beings endowed with finer sensitive power. They were
      abstractions mainly in so far as all other qualities were supposed
      absent. Demokritus professed to show how the movements,
      approximations, and collisions of these atoms, brought them into
      such combinations as to form the existing Kosmos; and not that
      system alone, but also many other cosmical systems, independent of
      and different from each other, which he supposed to exist. </p>

      <p>Marbach observes justly that the Demokritean atoms, though not
        really objects of sense in consequence of their smallness (of
        their disproportion to our visual power), are yet spoken of as
        objects of sense: they are as it were microscopic objects, and
        the &#947;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#951; &#947;&#957;&#974;&#956;&#951;, or intelligence, is conceived as supplying
        something of a microscopic power. (Marbach, Lehrbuch der

        Like atoms naturally tend towards like. Rotatory motion, the
        capital fact of the Kosmos. </span></p>
    <p>How this was done we cannot clearly make out, not having before
      us the original treatise of Demokritus, called the Great
      Diakosmos. It is certain, however, that he did not invoke any
      separate agency to set the atoms <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page73" id="v1page73"></a>73</span>in motion &#8212; such as
      the Love and Discord of Empedokles &#8212; the Nous or Intelligence of
      Anaxagoras. Demokritus supposed that the atoms moved by an
      inherent force of their own: that this motion was as much without
      beginning as the atoms themselves:<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_212"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_212"><span class="sp">212</span></a> that
      eternal motion was no less natural, no more required any special
      cause to account for it, than eternal rest. &#8220;Such is the course of
      nature &#8212; such is and always has been the fact,&#8221; was his ultimatum.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_213" href="#Footnotev1_1_213"><span
          class="sp">213</span></a> He farther maintained that all the
      motions of the atoms were necessary &#8212; that is, that they followed
      each other in a determinate order, each depending upon some one or
      more antecedents, according to fixed laws, which he could not
      explain.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_214" href="#Footnotev1_1_214"><span

      foresight.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_215" href="#Footnotev1_1_215"><span
          class="sp">215</span></a> Demokritus seems to have supposed
      that like atoms had a spontaneous tendency towards like; that all,
      when uncombined, tended naturally downwards, yet with unequal
      force, owing to their different size, and weight proportional to
      size; that this unequal force brought them into impact and
      collision one with another, out of which was generated a rotatory
      motion, gradually extending itself, and comprehending a larger and
      larger number of them, up to a certain point, when an exterior
      membrane or shell was formed around them.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_216" href="#Footnotev1_1_216"><span
          class="sp">216</span></a> This rotatory motion was the capital
      fact which both constituted the Kosmos, and maintained the
      severance of its central and peripheral masses &#8212; Earth and Water
      in the centre &#8212; Air, Fire, and the celestial bodies, near the
      circumference. Demokritus, Anaxagoras, and Empedokles, imagined
      different preliminary hypotheses to get at the fact of rotation;
      but all employed the fact, when arrived at, as a basis from which
      to deduce the formation of the various cosmical bodies and their
      known manifestations.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_217"

      respect to these bodies &#8212; Sun, Moon, Stars, Earth, &amp;c. &#8212;
      Demokritus seems to have held several opinions like those of
      Anaxagoras. Both of them conceived the Sun as a redhot mass, and
      the Earth as a flat surface above and below, round horizontally
      like a drum, stationary in the centre of the revolving celestial
      bodies, and supported by the resistance of air beneath.<a

      <p>Aristotle blames Demokritus for thus acquiescing in the general

        to final causes. M. Lafaist, in a good dissertation, Sur la
        Philosophie Atomistique (Paris, 1833, p. 78), shows that this is
        exactly the ultimatum of natural philosophers at the present
        day. &#8220;Un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne se passait-il, si on lui en
        demandait la raison, il (Demokritus) r&eacute;pondait, &#8216;La chose
        se passe ainsi, parcequ&#8217;elle s&#8217;est toujours pass&eacute;e
        ainsi.&#8217; C&#8217;est, en d&#8217;autres termes, la seule r&eacute;ponse que
        font encore aujourd&#8217;hui les naturalistes. Suivant eux, une

        celle de D&eacute;mokrite, c&#8217;est que la nature demeure constante
        &agrave; elle-m&ecirc;me. La proposition de D&eacute;mokrite &#8212;

        Aristotle (Physic. ii. 4, p. 196, a. 25) says that Demokritus
        (he seems to mean Demokritus) described the motion of the atoms
        to form the cosmical system, as having taken place &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
        &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;. Upon which Mullach (Dem. Frag. p. 382) justly remarks
        &#8212; &#8220;Casu (&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;) videntur fieri, qu&aelig; naturali

        usurpabant, casum et fortunam vocaret &#8212; ipse tamen Democritus,
        abhorrens ab iis omnibus qu&aelig; destinatam causarum seriem
        tollerent rerumque naturam perturbarent, nihil juris
        fortun&aelig; et casui in singulis rebus concessit.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Zeller has a like remark upon the phrase of Aristotle, which is
        calculated to mislead as to the doctrine of Demokritus (Phil. d.
        Griech., i. p. 600, <span class="correction" title="amended
          from '2d'">2nd.</span> ed.). </p>
      <p>Dugald Stewart, in one of the Dissertations prefixed to the
        Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, has the like comment respecting
        the fundamental principle of the Epicurean (identical <i>quoad
          hoc</i> with the Demokritean) philosophy. </p>
      <p>&#8220;I cannot conclude this note without recurring to an
        observation ascribed by Laplace to Leibnitz &#8212; &#8216;that the <i>blind



          chance</i> of the Epicureans involves the supposition of an
        effect taking place without a cause&#8217;. This is a very incorrect
        statement of the philosophy taught by Lucretius, which nowhere
        gives countenance to such a supposition. The distinguishing
        tenet of this sect was, that the order of the universe does not
        imply the existence of <i>intelligent</i> causes, but may be
        accounted for by the active powers belonging to the atoms of
        matter: which active powers, being exerted through an
        indefinitely long period of time, might have produced, nay must
        have produced, exactly such a combination of things as that with
        which we are surrounded. This does not call in question the
        necessity of a cause to produce every effect, but, on the
        contrary, virtually assumes the truth of that axiom. It only
        excludes from these causes the attribute of intelligence. In the
        same way, when I apply the words <i>blind chance</i> to the
        throw of a die, I do not mean to deny that I am ultimately the
        cause of the particular event that is to take place: but only to
        intimate that I do not here act as a <i>designing</i> cause, in
        consequence of my ignorance of the various accidents to which
        the die is subjected while shaken in the box. If I am not
        mistaken, this Epicurean theory approaches very nearly to the
        scheme which it is the main object of the Essay on Probabilities
        (by Laplace) to inculcate.&#8221; (Stewart &#8212; First Dissertation, part
        ii. p. 139, note.)</p>

      belonged to each. It was only in some special cases that he thus
      connected determinate atoms with compounds of determinate quality;
      for example, in regard to the four Empedoklean elements. The atoms
      constituting heat or fire he affirmed to be small and globular,
      the most mobile, rapid, and penetrating of all; those constituting

      squeezed or thrust out at all apertures by the pressure of air on
      all the external parts. Such tendency was counteracted by the
      process of respiration, whereby mental or vital particles, being
      abundantly distributed throughout the air, were inhaled along with
      air, and formed an inward current which either prevented the
      escape, or compensated the loss, of those which were tending
      outwards. When breathing ceased, such inward current being no
      longer kept up, the vital particles in the interior were speedily
      forced out, and death ensued.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_223"

    <p>Though Demokritus conceived those mental particles as distributed
      all over the body, yet he recognised different mental aptitudes
      attached to different parts of the body. Besides the special
      organs of sense, he considered intelligence as attached to the
      brain, passion to the heart, and appetite to the liver:<a

          class="sp">224</span></a> the same tripartite division
      afterwards adopted by Plato. He gave an explanation of perception
      or sensation in its different varieties, as well as of
      intelligence or thought. Sensation and thought were, in his
      opinion, alike material, and alike mental. Both were affections of
      the same peculiar particles, vital or mental, within us: both were
      changes operated in these particles by effluvia or images from
      without; nevertheless the one change was different from the other.<a

        and perceptions. Colours. </span></p>
    <p>Proceeding upon his hypothesis of atoms and vacua as the only
      objective existences, he tried to show what particular
      modifications of atoms, in figure, size, and position, produced
      upon the sentient the impressions of different colours. He
      recognised four fundamental or simple colours &#8212; white, black, red,
      and green &#8212; of which all other colours were mixtures and
      combinations.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_227" href="#Footnotev1_1_227"><span
          class="sp">227</span></a> White colour (he said) was caused by
      smooth surfaces, which presented straight pores and a transparent
      structure, such as the interior surface of shells: where these
      smooth substances were brittle or friable, this arose from the
      constituent atoms being at once spherical and loosely connected
      together, whereby they presented the clearest passage through
      their pores, the least amount of shadow, and the purest white
      colour. From substances thus constituted, the effluvia flowed out
      easily, and passed through the intermediate air without becoming
      entangled or confused with it. Black colour was caused by rough,
      irregular, unequal substances, which had their pores crooked and
      obstructed, casting much shadow, and sending forth slowly their
      effluvia, which became hampered and entangled with the intervening
      medium of air. Red colour arose from the effluvia of spherical
      atoms, like those of fire, though of larger size: the connection
      between red colour and fire was proved by the fact that heated
      substances, man as well as the metals, became red. Green was
      produced by atoms of large size and wide vacua, not restricted to
      any determinate shape, but arranged in peculiar order and
      position. These four were given by Demokritus as the simple
      colours. But he recognised an infinite diversity of compound
      colours, arising from mixture of them in different proportions,
      several of which he explained &#8212; gold-colour, purple, blue, violet,
      leek-green, nut-brown, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_228"

        p. 442, b. 10. The opinions of Demokritus on colour are
        illustrated at length by Prantl in his Uebersicht der
        Farbenlehre der Alten (p. 49 seq.), appended to his edition of
        the Aristotelian or Pseudo-Aristotelian treatise, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#935;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;
        (Munich, 1849). </p>
      <p>Demokritus seems also to have attempted to show, that the
        sensation of cold and shivering was produced by the irruption of
        jagged and acute atoms. See Plutarch, De Primo Frigido, p. 947,
        948, c. 8.</p>

    <p>Besides thus setting forth those varieties of atoms and atomic
      motions which produced corresponding varieties of colour,
      Demokritus also brought to view the intermediate stages whereby
      they realised the act of vision. All objects, compounds of the
      atoms, gave out effluvia or images resembling themselves. These
      effluvia stamped their impression, first upon the intervening air,
      next upon the eye beyond: which, being covered by a fine membrane,
      and consisting partly of water, partly of vacuum, was well
      calculated to admit the image. Such an image, the like of which
      any one might plainly see by looking into another person&#8217;s eye,
      was the immediate cause of vision.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_229"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_229"><span class="sp">229</span></a> The
      air, however, was no way necessary as an intervening medium, but
      rather obstructive: the image proceeding from the object would be
      more clearly impressed upon the eye through a vacuum: if the air
      did not exist, vision would be so distinct, even at the farthest
      distance, that an object not larger than an ant might be seen in
      the heavens.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_230" href="#Footnotev1_1_230"><span
          class="sp">230</span></a> Demokritus believed that the visual
      image, after having been impressed upon the eye, was distributed
      or multiplied over the remaining body.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_231"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_231"><span class="sp">231</span></a> In like
      manner, he believed that, in hearing, the condensed air carrying
      the sound entered with some violence through the ears, passed
      through the veins to the brain, and was from thence dispersed over
      the body.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_232" href="#Footnotev1_1_232"><span
          class="sp">232</span></a> Both sight and hearing were thus not
      simply acts of the organ of sense, but concurrent operations of
      the entire frame: over all which (as has been already stated) the
      mental or vital particles were assumed to be disseminated. </p>

      <p>Demokritus thought that air entered into the system not only
        through the ears, but also through pores in other parts of the
        body, though so gently as to be imperceptible to our
        consciousness: the ears afforded a large aperture, and admitted
        a considerable mass.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_1_76"></a>Differences of taste &#8212; how explained.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Farther, Demokritus conceived that the diversities of taste were
      generated by corresponding diversities of atoms, or compounds of
      atoms, of particular figure, magnitude and position. Acid taste
      was caused by atoms rough, angular, twisted, small, and subtle,
      which <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page79" id="v1page79"></a>79</span>forced



      their way through all the body, produced large interior vacant
      spaces, and thereby generated great heat: for heat was always
      proportional to the amount of vacuum within.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_233" href="#Footnotev1_1_233"><span
          class="sp">233</span></a> Sweet taste was produced by
      spherical atoms of considerable bulk, which slid gently along and
      diffused themselves equably over the body, modifying and softening
      the atoms of an opposite character. Astringent taste was caused by
      large atoms with many angles, which got into the vessels,
      obstructing the movement of fluids both in the veins and
      intestines. Salt taste was produced by large atoms, much entangled
      with each other, and irregular. In like manner Demokritus assigned
      to other tastes particular varieties of generating atoms: adding,
      however, that in every actual substance, atoms of different
      figures were intermingled, so that the effect of each on the whole
      was only realised in the ratio of the preponderating figure.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_234" href="#Footnotev1_1_234"><span
          class="sp">234</span></a> Lastly, the working of all atoms, in
      the way of taste, was greatly modified by the particular system
      upon which they were brought to act: effects totally opposite
      being sometimes produced by like atoms upon different individuals.<a

    <p>As sensation, so also thought or intelligence, was produced by
      the working of atoms from without. But in what manner the
      different figures and magnitudes of atoms were understood to act,
      in producing diverse modifications of thought, we do not find
      explained. It was, however, requisite that there should be a
      symmetry, or correspondence of condition between the thinking mind
      within and the inflowing atoms from without, in order that these
      latter might work upon a man properly: if he were too hot, or too
      cold, his mind went astray.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_236"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_236"><span class="sp">236</span></a> Though
      Demokritus identified the mental or vital particles with the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page80" id="v1page80"></a>80</span>spherical



      atoms constituting heat or fire, he nevertheless seems to have
      held that these particles might be in excess as well as in
      deficiency, and that they required, as a condition of sound mind,
      to be diluted or attempered with others. The soundest mind,
      however, did not work by itself or spontaneously, but was put in
      action by atoms or effluvia from without: this was true of the
      intellectual mind, not less than of the sensational mind. There
      was an objective something without, corresponding to and
      generating every different thought &#8212; just as there was an
      objective something corresponding to every different sensation.
      But first, the object of sensation was an atomic compound having
      some appreciable bulk, while that of thought might be separate
      atoms or vacua so minute as to be invisible and intangible. Next,
      the object of sensation did not reveal itself as it was in its own
      nature, but merely produced changes in the percipient, and
      different changes in different percipients (except as to heavy and
      light, hard and soft, which were not simply modifications of our
      sensibility, but were also primary qualities inherent in the
      objects themselves<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_237"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_237"><span class="sp">237</span></a>): while
      the object of thought, though it worked a change in the thinking
      subject, yet also revealed itself as it was, and worked alike upon
      all. </p>

      <p>This is a remarkable point to be noted in the criticisms of
        Theophrastus on the doctrine of Demokritus. Demokritus maintains
        that <i>hot</i> and <i>cold</i> are relative to us: <i>hard</i>
        and <i>soft</i>, <i>heavy</i> and <i>light</i>, are not only
        relative to us, but also absolute, objective, things in their
        own nature, &#8212; though causing in us sensations which are like
        them. Theophrastus denies this distinction altogether: and
        denies it with the best reason. Not many of his criticisms on
        Demokritus are so just and pertinent as this one.</p>

    <p>As Demokritus supposed both sensations and thoughts to be
      determined by effluvia from without, so he assumed a similar cause
      to account for beliefs, comfortable or uncomfortable dispositions,
      fancies, dreams, presentiments, &amp;c. He supposed that the air
      contained many effluences, spectres, images, cast off from persons
      and substances in nature &#8212; sometimes even from outlying very
      distant objects which lay beyond the bounds of the Kosmos. Of
      these images, impregnated with the properties, bodily and mental,
      of the objects from whence they came, some were beneficent, others
      mischievous: they penetrated into the human body through the pores
      and spread their influence all through the system.<a

      inflicted suffering corresponding to the tempers of those with

        href="#Footnotev1_1_242"><span class="sp">242</span></a> dreams,
      divinations, prophetic warnings, and threats, were communicated:
      sometimes, pestilence and other misfortunes were thus begun.
      Demokritus believed that men&#8217;s happiness depended much upon the
      nature and character of the images which might approach them,
      expressing an anxious wish that he might himself meet with such as
      were propitious.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_243"

        ethical views.</span> </p>
    <p>Among the lost treasures of Hellenic intellect, there are few
      which are more to be regretted than the works of Demokritus.
      Little is known of them except the titles: but these are
      instructive as well as multifarious. The number of different
      subjects which they embrace is astonishing. Besides his atomic
      theory, and its application to cosmogony and physics, whereby he
      is chiefly known, and from whence his title of <i>physicus</i>
      was derived &#8212; we find mention of works on geometry, arithmetic,
      astronomy, optics, geography or geology, zoology, botany,
      medicine, music, and poetry, grammar, history, ethics, &amp;c.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_1_244" href="#Footnotev1_1_244"><span
          class="sp">244</span></a> In such universality he is the
      predecessor, perhaps the model, of Aristotle. It is not likely
      that this wide range of subjects should have been handled in a
      spirit of empty generality, without facts or particulars: for we
      know that his life was long, his curiosity insatiable, and his
      personal travel and observation greater than that of any
      contemporary. We know too that he entered more or less upon the
      field of dialectics, discussing those questions of evidence which
      became so rife in the Platonic age. He criticised, and is said to
      have combated, the doctrine laid down by Protagoras, &#8220;Man is the
      measure of all things&#8221;. It would have been interesting to know
      from what point of view he approached it: but we learn only the
      fact that he criticised it adversely.<a name="FnAnchorv1_1_245"
        href="#Footnotev1_1_245"><span class="sp">245</span></a> The
      numerous treatises of Demokritus, together with the proportion of
      them which relate to ethical and social subjects, rank him with
      the philosophers of the Platonic and Aristotelian age. His <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page83" id="v1page83"></a>83</span>Summum



      Bonum, as far as we can make out, appears to have been the
      maintenance of mental serenity and contentment: in which view he
      recommended a life of tranquil contemplation, apart from
      money-making, or ambition, or the exciting pleasures of life.<a

        See the list of the works of Demokritus in Diogen. Laert. ix.
        46, and in Mullach&#8217;s edition of the Fragments, p. 105-107.
        Mullach mentions here (note 18) that Demokritus is cited
        seventy-eight times in the extant works of Aristotle, and
        sometimes with honourable mention. He is never mentioned by
        Plato. In the fragment of Philodemus de Musica, Demokritus is
        called &#7936;&#957;&#8052;&#961; &#959;&#8016; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;

        Comp. Verb. p. 187, R.) characterises Demokritus, Plato, and

        the philosophers, in respect of &#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;.</p>

    <h2>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE EARLIER PHILOSOPHERS &#8212; GROWTH OF

        multiplicity of individual authorities is the characteristic of
        Greek philosophy.</span> </p>
    <p>The first feeling of any reader accustomed to the astronomy and
      physics of the present century, on considering the various
      theories noticed in the preceding chapter, is a sort of
      astonishment that such theories should have been ever propounded
      or accepted as true. Yet there can be no doubt that they represent
      the best thoughts of sincere, contemplative, and ingenious men,
      furnished with as much knowledge of fact, and as good a method, as
      was then attainable. The record of what such men have received as
      scientific truth or probability, in different ages, is instructive
      in many ways, but in none more than in showing how essentially
      relative and variable are the conditions of human belief; how
      unfounded is the assumption of those modern philosophers who
      proclaim certain first truths or first principles as universal,
      intuitive, self-evident; how little any theorist can appreciate <i>&agrave;



        priori</i> the causes of belief in an age materially different
      from his own, or can lay down maxims as to what must be
      universally believed or universally disbelieved by all mankind. We
      shall have farther illustration of this truth as we proceed: here
      I only note variety of belief, even on the most fundamental
      points, as being the essential feature of Grecian philosophy even
      from its outset, long before the age of those who are usually
      denounced as the active sowers of discord, the Sophists and the
      professed disputants. Each philosopher followed his own individual
      reason, departing from traditional or established creeds, and
      incurring from the believing public more <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page85" id="v1page85"></a>85</span>or less of obloquy;
      but no one among the philosophers acquired marked supremacy over
      the rest. There is no established philosophical orthodoxy, but a
      collection of Dissenters &#8212; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951; &#948;&#8217; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957; &#947;&#955;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#945; &#956;&#949;&#956;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#8212; small
      sects, each with its own following, each springing from a special
      individual as authority, each knowing itself to be only one among
      many. </p>

        from their own writings, which have been lost. Importance of the
        information of Aristotle about them.</span> </p>
    <p>It is a misfortune that we do not possess a complete work, or
      even considerable fragments, from any one of these philosophers,
      so as to know what their views were when stated by themselves, and
      upon what reasons they insisted. All that we know is derived from
      a few detached notices, in very many cases preserved by Aristotle;
      who, not content (like Plato) with simply following out his own
      vein of ideas, exhibits in his own writings much of that polymathy
      which he transmitted to the Peripatetics generally, and adverts
      often to the works of predecessors. Being a critic as well as a
      witness, he sometimes blends together inconveniently the two
      functions, and is accused (probably with reason to a certain
      extent) of making unfair reports; but if it were not for him, we
      should really know nothing of the Hellenic philosophers before
      Plato. It is curious to read the manner in which Aristotle speaks
      of these philosophical predecessors as &#8220;the ancients&#8221; (&#959;&#7985;
      &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;), and takes credit to his own philosophy for having
      attained a higher and more commanding point of view.<a

        Bacon ascribes the extinction of these early Greek philosophers
        to Aristotle, who thought that he could not assure his own
        philosophical empire, except by putting to death all his
        brothers, like the Turkish Sultan. This remark occurs more than
        once in Bacon (Nov. Org. Aph. 67; Redargutio Philosoph. vol. xi.
        p. 450, ed. Montagu). In so far as it is a reproach, I think it
        is not deserved. Aristotle&#8217;s works, indeed, have been preserved,
        and those of his predecessors have not: but Aristotle, far from
        seeking to destroy their works, has been the chief medium for
        preserving to us the little which we know about them. His
        attention to the works of his predecessors is something very
        unusual among the theorists of the ancient world. His friends
        Eud&ecirc;mus and Theophrastus followed his example, in
        embodying the history of the earlier theories in distinct works
        of their own, now unfortunately lost. </p>
      <p>It is much to be regretted that no scholar has yet employed
        himself in collecting and editing the fragments of the lost
        scientific histories of Eud&ecirc;mus (the Rhodian) and
        Theophrastus. A new edition of the Commentaries of Simplikius is
        also greatly wanted: those which exist are both rare and
        unreadable. </p>
      <p>Zeller remarks that several of the statements contained in
        Proklus&#8217;s commentary on Euclid, respecting the earliest Grecian
        mathematicians, are borrowed from the &#947;&#949;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953; of
        the Rhodian Eud&ecirc;mus (Zeller &#8212; De Hermodoro Ephesio et
        Hermodoro Platonico, p. 12).</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_2_3"></a>Abundance of speculative genius and
        invention &#8212; a memorable fact in the Hellenic mind. </span></p>
    <p>During the century and a half between Thales and the beginning of
      the Peloponnesian war, we have passed in review twelve distinct
      schemes of philosophy &#8212; Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes,
      Xenophanes, Pythagoras, Parmenides, Herakleitus, Empedokles,
      Anaxagoras, the Apolloniate Diogenes, Leukippus, and Demokritus.
      Of most of these philosophers it may fairly be said that each
      speculated upon nature in an original vein of his own. Anaximenes
      and Diogenes, Xenophanes and Parmenides, Leukippus and Demokritus,
      may indeed be coupled together as kindred pairs yet by no means in
      such manner that the second of the two is a mere disciple and
      copyist of the first. Such abundance and variety of speculative
      genius and invention is one of the most memorable facts in the
      history of the Hellenic mind. The prompting of intelligent
      curiosity, the thirst for some plausible hypothesis to explain the
      Kosmos and its generation, the belief that a basis or point of
      departure might be found in the Kosmos itself, apart from those
      mythical personifications which dwelt both in the popular mind and
      in the poetical Theogonies, the mental effort required to select
      some known agency and to connect it by a chain of reasoning with
      the result &#8212; all this is a new phenomenon in the history of the
      human mind. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_2_4"
          id="Sidenotev1_2_4"></a>Difficulties which a Grecian
        philosopher had to overcome &#8212; prevalent view of Nature,
        established, impressive, and misleading.</span> </p>
    <p>An early Greek philosopher found nothing around him to stimulate
      or assist the effort, and much to obstruct it. He found Nature
      disguised under a diversified and omnipresent Polytheistic agency,
      eminently captivating and impressive to the emotions &#8212; at once
      mysterious and familiar &#8212; embodied in the ancient Theogonies, and
      penetrating deeply all the abundant epic and lyric poetry, the
      only literature of the time. It is perfectly true (as Aristotle
      remarks<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_2" href="#Footnotev1_2_2"><span
          class="sp">2</span></a>) that Hesiod and the other theological
      poets, who referred everything to the generation and agency of the
      Gods, thought only of what was plausible to themselves, without
      enquiring whether it would <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page87" id="v1page87"></a>87</span>appear equally
      plausible to their successors; a reproach which bears upon many
      subsequent philosophers also. The contemporary public, to whom
      they addressed themselves, knew no other way of conceiving Nature
      than under this religious and poetical view, as an aggregate of
      manifestations by divine personal agents, upon whose volition &#8212;
      sometimes signified beforehand by obscure warnings intelligible to
      the privileged interpreters, but often inscrutable &#8212; the turn of
      events depended. Thales and the other Ionic philosophers were the
      first who became dissatisfied with this point of view, and sought
      for some &#8220;causes and beginnings&#8221; more regular, knowable, and
      predictable. They fixed upon the common, familiar,
      widely-extended, material substances, water, air, fire, &amp;c.;
      and they could hardly fix upon any others. Their attempt to find a
      scientific basis was unsuccessful; but the memorable fact
      consisted in their looking for one. </p>

      God. Pythagoras and Empedokles blend with their speculations a
      good deal both of ethics and theology, which we shall find yet
      more preponderant when we come to the cosmical theories of Plato.
      He brings us back to the mythical Prometheus, armed with the
      geometrical and arithmetical combinations of the Pythagoreans: he
      assumes a chaotic substratum, modified by the intentional and
      deliberate construction of the Demiurgus and his divine sons, who
      are described as building up and mixing like a human artisan or
      chemist. In the theory of Aristotle we find Nature half
      personified, and assumed to be perpetually at work under the
      influence of an appetite for good or regularity, which determines
      her to aim instinctively and without deliberation (like bees or
      spiders) at constant ends, though these regular tendencies are
      always accompanied, and often thwarted, by accessories, irregular,
      undefinable, unpredictable. Both Plato and Aristotle, in their
      dialectical age, carried abstraction farther than it had been
      carried by the Ionic philosophers.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_3"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Aristotle
      imputes to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page88"
          id="v1page88"></a>88</span>Ionic philosophers that they
      neglected three out of his four causes (the efficient, formal, and
      final), and that they attended only to the material. This was a
      height of abstraction first attained by Plato and himself; in a
      way sometimes useful, sometimes misleading. The earlier
      philosophers had not learnt to divide substance from its powers or
      properties; nor to conceive substance without power as one thing,
      and power without substance as another. Their primordial
      substance, with its powers and properties, implicated together as
      one concrete and without any abstraction, was at once an
      efficient, a formal, and a material cause: a final cause they did
      not suppose themselves to want, inasmuch as they always conceived
      a fixed terminus towards which the agency was directed, though
      they did not conceive such fixed tendency under the symbol of an
      appetite and its end. Water, Air, Fire, were in their view not
      simply inert and receptive patients, impotent until they were
      stimulated by the active force residing in the ever revolving
      celestial spheres &#8212; but positive agents themselves, productive of
      important effects. So also a geologist of the present day, when he
      speculates upon the early condition<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_4"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> of the
      Kosmos, reasons upon gaseous, fluid, solid, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page89" id="v1page89"></a>89</span>varieties of
      matter, as manifesting those same laws and properties which
      experience attests, but manifesting them under different
      combinations and circumstances. The defect of the Ionic
      philosophers, unavoidable at the time, was, that possessing
      nothing beyond a superficial experience, they either ascribed to
      these physical agents powers and properties not real, or
      exaggerated prodigiously such as were real; so that the primordial
      substance chosen, though bearing a familiar name, became little
      better than a fiction. The Pythagoreans did the same in regard to
      numbers, ascribing to them properties altogether fanciful and
      imaginary. </p>

        Plato (Sophistes, 242-243) observes respecting these early
        theorists &#8212; what Aristotle says about Hesiod and the Theogonies
        &#8212; that they followed out their own subjective veins of thought
        without asking whether we, the many listeners, were able to
        follow them or were left behind in the dark. I dare say that
        this was true (as indeed it is true respecting most writers on
        speculative matters), but I am sure that all of them would have
        made the same complaint if they had heard Plato read his
        Tim&aelig;us.</p>

        Bacon has some striking remarks on the contrast in this respect

      <p>Bacon, after commending the early Greek philosophers for having

      <p>&#8220;Science was not merely stationary, but often retrograde; and

    <p>Parmenides and Pythagoras, taking views of the Kosmos
      metaphysical and geometrical rather than physical, supplied the
      basis upon which Plato&#8217;s speculations were built. Aristotle
      recognises Empedokles and Anaxagoras as having approached to his
      own doctrine &#8212; force abstracted or considered apart from
      substance, yet not absolutely detached from it. This is true about
      Empedokles to a certain extent, since his theory admits Love and
      Enmity as agents, the four elements as patients: but it is hardly
      true about Anaxagoras, in whose theory No&ucirc;s imparts nothing
      more than a momentary shock, exercising what modern chemists <span

          id="Sidenotev1_2_7"></a>Advantage derived from this variety of
        constructive imagination among the Greeks. </span></p>
    <p>In the number of cosmical theories proposed, from Thales to
      Demokritus, as well as in the diversity and even discordance of
      the principles on which they were founded &#8212; we note not merely the
      growth and development of scientific curiosity, but also the
      spontaneity and exuberance of constructive imagination.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_2_5" href="#Footnotev1_2_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
      This last is a prominent attribute of the Hellenic mind, displayed
      to the greatest advantage in their poetical, oratorical,
      historical, artistic, productions, and transferred from thence to
      minister to their scientific curiosity. None of their known
      contemporaries showed the like aptitudes, not even the Babylonians
      and Egyptians, who were diligent in the observation of the
      heavens. Now the constructive imagination is not less
      indispensable to the formation of scientific theories than to the
      compositions of art, although in the two departments it is subject
      to different conditions, and appeals to different canons and tests
      in the human mind. Each of these early Hellenic theories, though
      all were hypotheses and &#8220;anticipations of nature,&#8221; yet as
      connecting together various facts upon intelligible principles,
      was a step in advance; while the very number and discordance of
      them (urged by Sokrates<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_6"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> as an
      argument for discrediting the purpose common to all), was on the
      whole advantageous. It lessened the mischief arising from the
      imperfections of each, increased the chance of exposing such
      imperfections, and prevented the consecration of any one among
      them (with that inveterate and peremptory orthodoxy which Plato so
      much admires<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_7" href="#Footnotev1_2_7"><span
          class="sp">7</span></a> in the Egyptians) as an infallible
      dogma and an exclusive mode of <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page91" id="v1page91"></a>91</span>looking at facts.
      All the theorists laboured under the common defect of a scanty and
      inaccurate experience: all of them were prompted by a vague but
      powerful emotion of curiosity to connect together the past and
      present of Nature by some threads intelligible and satisfactory to
      their own minds; each of them followed out some analogy of his
      own, such as seemed to carry with it a self-justifying
      plausibility; and each could find some phenomena which
      countenanced his own peculiar view. As far as we can judge,
      Leukippus and Demokritus greatly surpassed the others, partly in
      the pains which they took to elaborate their theory, partly in the
      number of facts which they brought into consistency with it. The
      loss of the voluminous writings of Demokritus is deeply to be
      regretted.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_8" href="#Footnotev1_2_8"><span

        Importance of the scrutiny of negative Dialectic. </span></p>
    <p>In studying the writings of Plato and Aristotle, we must
      recollect that they found all these theories pre-existent or
      contemporaneous. We are not to imagine that they were the first
      who turned an enquiring eye on Nature. So far is this from being
      the case that Aristotle is, as it were, oppressed both by the
      multitude and by the discordance of his predecessors, whom he
      cites, with a sort of indulgent consciousness of superiority, as
      &#8220;the ancients&#8221; (&#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;).<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_9"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The
      dialectic activity, inaugurated by Sokrates and Zeno, lowered the
      estimation of these cosmical theories in more ways than one:
      first, by the new topics of man and society, which Sokrates put in
      the foreground for discussion, and treated as the only topics
      worthy of discussion: next, by the great acuteness which each of
      them displayed in the employment of the negative weapons, and in
      bringing to view the weak part of an opponent&#8217;s case. When we look
      at the number of these early theories, and the great need which
      all of them had to be sifted and scrutinised, we shall recognise
      the value of negative procedure under such circumstances, whether
      the negationist had or had not any better affirmative theory of
      his own. Sokrates, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page92"
          id="v1page92"></a>92</span>moreover, not only turned the
      subject-matter of discussion from physics to ethics, but also
      brought into conscious review the <i>method</i> of
      philosophising: which was afterwards still farther considered and
      illustrated by Plato. General and abstract terms and their
      meaning, stood out as the capital problems of philosophical
      research, and as the governing agents of the human mind during the
      process: in Plato and Aristotle, and the Dialectics of their age,
      we find the meaning or concept corresponding to these terms
      invested with an objective character, and represented as a cause
      or beginning; by which, or out of which, real concrete things were
      produced. Logical, metaphysical, ethical, entities, whose
      existence consists in being named and reasoned about, are
      presented to us (by Plato) as the real antecedents and producers
      of the sensible Kosmos and its contents, or (by Aristotle) as
      coeternal with the Kosmos, but as its underlying constituents &#8212;
      the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054;, primordia or ultimata &#8212; into which it was the purpose
      and duty of the philosopher to resolve sensible things. The men of
      words and debate, the dialecticians or metaphysical speculators of
      the period since Zeno and Sokrates, who took little notice of the
      facts of Nature, stand contrasted in the language of Aristotle
      with the antecedent physical philosophers who meddled less with
      debate and more with facts. The contrast is taken in his mind
      between Plato and Demokritus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_10"

    <p>It is Zeno who stands announced, on the authority of Aristotle,
      as the inventor of dialectic: that is, as the first person of
      whose skill in the art of cross-examination and refutation
      conspicuous illustrative specimens were preserved. He was among
      the first who composed written dialogues on controversial matters

      It is remarkable that both one and the other were eminent as
      political men in their native cities. Zeno is even said to have
      perished miserably, in generous but fruitless attempts to preserve

        opponents of Parmenides, by showing that their assumptions led
        to contradictions and absurdities.</span></p>
    <p>We know the reasonings of Zeno and Melissus only through scanty
      fragments, and those fragments transmitted by opponents. But it is
      plain that both of them, especially Zeno, pressed their
      adversaries with grave difficulties, which it was more easy to
      deride than to elucidate. Both took their departure from the
      ground occupied by Parmenides. They agreed with him in recognising
      the phenomenal, apparent, or relative world, the world of sense
      and experience, as a subject of knowledge, though of uncertain and
      imperfect knowledge. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page94"
          id="v1page94"></a>94</span>Each of them gave, as Parmenides
      had done, certain affirmative opinions, or at least probable
      conjectures, for the purpose of explaining it.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_2_14" href="#Footnotev1_2_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
      But beyond this world of appearances, there lay the real,
      absolute, ontological, ultra-phenomenal, or Noumenal world, which
      Parmenides represented as <i>Ens unum continuum</i>, and which
      his opponents contended to be plural and discontinuous. These
      opponents deduced absurd and ridiculous consequences from the
      theory of the One. Herein both Zeno and Melissus defended
      Parmenides. Zeno, the better dialectician of the two, retorted
      upon the advocates of absolute plurality and discontinuousness,
      showing that their doctrine led to consequences not less absurd
      and contradictory than the <i>Ens unum</i> of Parmenides. He
      advanced many distinct arguments; some of them antinomies,
      deducing from the same premisses both the affirmative and the
      negative of the same conclusion.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_15"

    <p>If things in themselves were many (he said) they must be both
      infinitely small and infinitely great. <i>Infinitely small</i>,
      because the many things must consist in a number of units, each
      essentially indivisible: but that which is indivisible has no
      magnitude, or is infinitely small if indeed it can be said to have
      any existence whatever:<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_16"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> <i>Infinitely



        great</i>, because each of the many things, if assumed to exist,
      must have <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page95" id="v1page95"></a>95</span>magnitude.



      Having magnitude, each thing has parts which also have magnitude:
      these parts are, by the hypothesis, essentially discontinuous, but
      this implies that they are kept apart from each other by other
      intervening parts &#8212; and these intervening parts must be again kept
      apart by others. Each body will thus contain in itself an infinite
      number of parts, each having magnitude. In other words, it will be
      infinitely great.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_17" href="#Footnotev1_2_17"><span

      <p>Seneca (Epistol. 88) and Alexander of Aphrodisias (see the
        passages of Themistius and Simplikius cited by Brandis, Handbuch
        Philos. i. p. 412-416) conceive Zeno as having dissented from
        Parmenides, and as having denied the existence, not only of &#964;&#8048;
        &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048;, but also of &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957;. But Zeno seems to have adhered to
        Parmenides; and to have denied the existence of &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957;, only upon
        the hypothesis opposed to Parmenides &#8212; namely, that &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048;
        existed. Zeno argued thus:&#8212;Assuming that the Real or Absolute is
        essentially divisible and discontinuous, divisibility must be
        pushed to infinity, so that you never arrive at any ultimatum,
        or any real unit (&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#8182;&#962; &#7957;&#957;). If you admit &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048;, you
        renounce &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957;. The reasoning of Zeno, as far as we know it, is
        nearly all directed against the hypothesis of <i>Entia plura
          discontinua</i>. Tennemann (Gesch. Philos. i. 4, p. 205)
        thinks that the reasoning of Zeno is directed against the world
        of sense: in which I cannot agree with him.</p>

    <p>Again &#8212; If things in themselves were many, they would be both
      finite and infinite in number. <i>Finite</i>, because they are as
      many as they are, neither more nor less: and every number is a
      finite number. <i>Infinite</i>, because being essentially
      separate, discontinuous, units, each must be kept apart from the
      rest by an intervening unit; and this again by something else
      intervening. Suppose a multitude A, B, C, D, &amp;c. A and B would
      be continuous unless they were kept apart by some intervening unit
      Z. But A and Z would then be continuous unless they were kept
      apart by something else &#8212; Y: and so on ad infinitum: otherwise the
      essential discontinuousness could not be maintained.<a

    <p>Another argument of Zeno is to the following effect:&#8212;&#8220;Does a
      grain of millet, when dropped upon the floor, make sound? No. &#8212;
      Does a bushel of millet make sound under the same circumstances?
      Yes. &#8212; Is there not a determinate proportion between the bushel
      and the grain? There is. &#8212; There must therefore be the same
      proportion between the sonorousness of the two. If one grain be
      not sonorous, neither can ten thousand grains be so.&#8221;<a

    </div>
    <p>To appreciate the contradiction brought out by Zeno, we must
      recollect that he is not here reasoning about facts of sense,
      phenomenal and relative &#8212; but about things in themselves, absolute
      and ultra-phenomenal realities. He did not deny the fact of sense:
      to appeal to that fact in reply, would have been to concede his
      point. The adversaries against whom he reasoned (Protagoras is
      mentioned, but he can hardly have been among them, if we have
      regard to his memorable dogma, of which more will be said
      presently) were those who maintained the plurality of absolute
      substances, each for itself, with absolute attributes, apart from
      the fact of sense, and independent of any sentient subject. One
      grain of millet (Zeno argues) has no absolute sonorousness,
      neither can ten thousand such grains taken together have any. Upon
      the hypothesis of absolute reality as a discontinuous multitude,
      you are here driven to a contradiction which Zeno intends as an
      argument against the hypothesis. There is no absolute sonorousness
      in the ten thousand grains: the sound which they make is a
      phenomenal fact, relative to us as sentients of sound, and having
      no reality except in correlation with a hearer.<a

        It will be seen that Aristotle in explaining this &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;, takes
        into consideration the difference of force in the vibrations of
        air, and the different impressibility of the ear. The
        explanation is pertinent and just, if applied to the fact of
        sense: but it is no reply to Zeno, who did not call in question
        the fact of sense. Zeno is impugning the doctrine of absolute
        substances and absolute divisibility. To say that ten thousand
        grains are sonorous, but that no one of them separately taken is
        so, appears to him a contradiction, similar to what is involved
        in saying that a real magnitude is made up of mathematical
        points. Aristotle does not meet this difficulty.</p>

    <p>Other memorable arguments of Zeno against the same hypothesis
      were those by which he proved that if it were admitted, motion
      would be impossible. Upon the theory of absolute plurality and
      discontinuousness, every line or portion of distance was divisible
      into an infinite number of parts: before a moving body could get
      from the beginning to the end of this line, it must pass in
      succession over every one of these parts: but to do this in a
      finite time was impossible: therefore motion was impossible.<a

      <p>These four arguments against absolute motion caused

        &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
    <p>A second argument of the same tendency was advanced in the form
      of comparison between Achilles and the tortoise &#8212; the swiftest and
      slowest movers. The two run a race, a certain start being given to
      the tortoise. Zeno contends that Achilles can never overtake the
      tortoise. It is plain indeed, according to the preceding argument,
      that motion both for the one and for the other is an
      impossibility. Neither one nor the other can advance from the
      beginning to the end of any line, except by passing successively
      through all the parts of that line: but those parts are infinite
      in number, and cannot therefore be passed through in any finite
      time. But suppose such impossibility to be got over: still
      Achilles will not overtake the tortoise. For while Achilles
      advances one hundred yards, the tortoise has advanced ten: while
      Achilles passes over these additional ten yards, the tortoise will
      have passed over one more yard: while Achilles is passing over
      this remaining one yard, the tortoise will have got over one-tenth
      of another yard: and so on ad infinitum: the tortoise will always
      be in advance of him by a certain distance, which, though ever
      diminishing, will never vanish into nothing. </p>
    <p>The third Zenonian argument derived its name from the flight of
      an arrow shot from a bow. The arrow while thus carried forward
      (says Zeno) is nevertheless at rest.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_24"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> For the
      time from <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page98" id="v1page98"></a>98</span>the



      beginning to the end of its course consists of a multitude of
      successive instants. During each of these instants the arrow is in
      a given place of equal dimension with itself. But that which is
      during any instant in a given place, is at rest. Accordingly
      during each successive instant of its flight, the arrow is at
      rest. Throughout its whole flight it is both in motion and at
      rest. This argument is a deduction from the doctrine of
      discontinuous time, as the preceding is a deduction from that of
      discontinuous space. </p>

    <p>A fourth argument<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_25"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> was
      derived from the case of two equal bodies moved with equal
      velocity in opposite directions, and passing each other. If the
      body A B were at rest, the other body C D would move along the
      whole length of C D in two minutes. But if C D be itself moving
      with equal velocity in the opposite direction, A B will pass along
      the whole length of C D in half that time, or one minute. Hence
      Zeno infers that the motion of A B is nothing absolute, or
      belonging to the thing in itself &#8212; for if that were so, it would
      not be varied according to the movement of C D. It is no more than
      a phenomenal fact, relative to us and our comparison. </p>

    <p>This argument, so far as I can understand its bearing, is not
      deduced (as those preceding are) from the premisses of opponents:
      but rests upon premisses of its own, and is intended to prove that
      motion is only relative. </p>

        Zenonian Dialectic. Nothing is knowable except the relative. </span></p>
    <p>These Zenonian reasonings are memorable as the earliest known
      manifestations of Grecian dialectic, and are probably equal in
      acuteness and ingenuity to anything which it ever produced. Their
      bearing is not always accurately conceived. Most of them are <i>argumenta



        ad hominem</i>: consequences contradictory and inadmissible, but
      shown to follow legitimately from a given hypothesis, and
      therefore serving to disprove the hypothesis itself.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_2_26" href="#Footnotev1_2_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a>
      The hypothesis was one relating <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page99" id="v1page99"></a>99</span>to the real,
      absolute, or ultra-phenomenal, which Parmenides maintained to be <i>Ens



        Unum Continuum</i>, while his opponents affirmed it to be
      essentially multiple and discontinuous. Upon the hypothesis of
      Parmenides, the Real and Absolute, being a continuous One, was
      obviously inconsistent with the movement and variety of the
      phenomenal world: Parmenides himself recognised the contradiction
      of the two, and his opponents made it a ground for deriding his
      doctrine.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_27" href="#Footnotev1_2_27"><span
          class="sp">27</span></a> The counter-hypothesis, of the
      discontinuous many, appeared at first sight not to be open to the
      same objection: it seemed to be more in harmony with the facts of
      the phenomenal and relative world, and to afford an absolute basis
      for them to rest upon. Against this delusive appearance the
      dialectic of Zeno was directed. He retorted upon the opponents,
      and showed that if the hypothesis of the <i>Unum Continuum</i>
      led to absurd consequences, that of the discontinuous many was
      pregnant with deductions yet more absurd and contradictory. He
      exhibits in detail several of these contradictory deductions, with
      a view to refute the hypothesis from whence they flow; and to
      prove that, far from performing what it promises, it is worse than
      useless, as entangling us in contradictory conclusions. The result
      of his reasoning, implied rather than announced, is &#8212; That neither
      of the two hypotheses are of any avail to supply a real and
      absolute basis for the phenomenal and relative world: That the
      latter must rest upon its own evidence, and must be interpreted,
      in so far as it can be interpreted at all, by its own analogies. </p>

      <p>Here Plato evidently represents Zeno as merely proving that
        contradictory conclusions followed, <i>if you assumed a given
          hypothesis</i>; which hypothesis was thereby shown to be
        inadmissible. But Plato alludes to Zeno in another place
        (Ph&aelig;drus, c. 97, p. 261) under the name of the Eleatic
        Palamedes, as &#8220;showing his art in speaking, by making the same
        things appear to the hearers like and unlike, one and many, at
        rest and in motion&#8221;. In this last passage, the impression
        produced by Zeno&#8217;s argumentation is brought to view, apart from
        the scope and purpose with which he employed it: which scope and
        purpose are indicated in the passage above cited from the
        Parmenides. </p>

          ad absurdum</i> of an opponents doctrines to be
        generalisations of data gathered from experience.</span> </p>
    <p>But the purport of Zeno&#8217;s reasoning is mistaken, when he is <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page100" id="v1page100"></a>100</span>conceived



      as one who wishes to delude his hearers by proving both sides of a
      contradictory proposition. Zeno&#8217;s contradictory conclusions are
      elicited with the express purpose of disproving the premisses from
      which they are derived. For these premisses Zeno himself is not to
      be held responsible, since he borrows them from his opponents: a
      circumstance which Aristotle forgets, when he censures the
      Zenonian arguments as paralogisms, because they assume the
      Continua, Space, and Time, to be discontinuous or divided into
      many distinct parts.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_28"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> Now this
      absolute discontinuousness of matter, space, and time, was not
      advanced by Zeno as a doctrine of his own, but is the very
      doctrine of his opponents, taken up by him for the purpose of
      showing that it led to contradictory consequences, and thus of
      indirectly refuting it. The sentence of Aristotle is thus really
      in Zeno&#8217;s favour, though apparently adverse to him. In respect to
      motion, a similar result followed from the Zenonian reasonings;
      namely, to show That motion, as an attribute of the Real and
      Absolute, was no less inconsistent with the hypothesis of those
      who opposed Parmenides, than with the hypothesis of Parmenides
      himself:&#8212;That absolute motion could no more be reconciled with the
      doctrine of the discontinuous Many, than with that of the
      Continuous One:&#8212;That motion therefore was only a phenomenal fact,
      relative to our sensations, conceptions, and comparisons; and
      having no application to the absolute. In this phenomenal point of
      view, neither Zeno nor Parmenides nor Melissus disputed the fact
      of motion. They recognised it as a portion of the world of
      sensation and experience; which world they tried to explain, well
      or ill, by analogies and conjectures derived from itself. </p>

    <p>Though we have not the advantage of seeing the Zenonian
      dialectics as they were put forth by their author, yet if we
      compare the substance of them as handed down to us, with those
      dialectics which form the latter half of the Platonic dialogue
      called Parmenides, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page101"
          id="v1page101"></a>101</span>we shall find them not inferior
      in ingenuity, and certainly more intelligible in their purpose.
      Zeno furnishes no positive support to the Parmenidean doctrine,
      but he makes out a good negative case against the
      counter-doctrine. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_2_19"
          id="Sidenotev1_2_19"></a>Views of historians of philosophy
        respecting Zeno. </span></p>
    <p>Zeller and other able modern critics, while admitting the
      reasoning of Zeno to be good against this counter-doctrine,
      complain that he takes it up too exclusively; that One and Many
      did not exclude each other, and that the doctrines of Parmenides
      and his opponents were both true together, but neither of them
      true to the exclusion of the other. But when we reflect that the
      subject of predication on both sides was the Real (Ens <i>per se</i>)
      it was not likely that either Parmenides or his opponents would
      affirm it to be both absolutely One and Continuous, and absolutely
      Many and Discontinuous.<a name="FnAnchorv1_2_29"
        href="#Footnotev1_2_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> If the
      opponents of Parmenides had taken this ground, Zeno need not have
      imagined deductions for the purpose of showing that their
      hypothesis led to contradictory conclusions; for the
      contradictions would have stood avowedly registered in the
      hypothesis itself. If a man affirms both at once, he divests the
      predication of its absolute character, as belonging
      unconditionally to Ens <i>per se</i>; and he restricts it to the
      phenomenal, the relative, the conditioned &#8212; dependent upon our
      sensations and our fluctuating point of view. This was not
      intended either by Parmenides or by his opponents. </p>

        That both of them could not be true respecting Ens <i>per se</i>,
        seems to have been considered indisputable. See the argument of
        Sokrates in the Parmenides of Plato, p. 129 B-E.</p>

        unknowable.</span> </p>
    <p>If, indeed, we judge the question, not from their standing-point,
      but from our own, we shall solve the difficulty by adopting the
      last-mentioned answer. We shall admit that One and Many are
      predicates which do not necessarily exclude each other; but we
      shall refrain from affirming or denying either of them respecting
      the Real, the Absolute, the Unconditioned. Of an object absolutely
      one and continuous &#8212; or of objects absolutely many and
      discontinuous, apart from the facts of our own sense and
      consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page102"
          id="v1page102"></a>102</span> and independent of any sentient
      subject &#8212; we neither know nor can affirm anything. Both these
      predicates (One &#8212; Many) are relative and phenomenal, grounded on
      the facts and comparisons of our own senses and consciousness, and
      serving only to describe, to record, and to classify, those facts.
      Discrete quantity or number, or succession of distinct unities &#8212;
      continuous quantity, or motion and extension &#8212; are two conceptions
      derived from comparison, abstracted and generalised from separate
      particular phenomena of our consciousness; the continuous, from
      our movements and the consciousness of persistent energy involved
      therein &#8212; the discontinuous, from our movements, intermitted and
      renewed, as well as from our impressions of sense. We compare one
      discrete quantity with another, or one continual quantity with
      another, and we thus ascertain many important truths: but we
      select our unit, or our standard of motion and extension, as we
      please, or according to convenience, subject only to the necessity
      of adapting our ulterior calculations consistently to this unit,
      when once selected. The same object may thus be considered
      sometimes as one, sometimes as many; both being relative, and
      depending upon our point of view. Motion, Space, Time, may be
      considered either as continuous or as discontinuous: we may reason
      upon them either as one or the other, but we must not confound the
      two points of view with each other. When, however, we are called
      upon to travel out of the Relative, and to decide between
      Parmenides and his opponents &#8212; whether the Absolute be One or
      Multitudinous &#8212; we have only to abstain from affirming either, or
      (in other words) to confess our ignorance. We know nothing of an
      absolute, continuous, self-existent One, or of an absolute,
      discontinuous Many. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_2_21"></a>Zeno did not deny motion as a fact,
        phenomenal and relative.</span> </p>
    <p>Some critics understand Zeno to have denied motion as a fact &#8212;
      opposing sophistical reasoning to certain and familiar experience.
      Upon this view is founded the well-known anecdote, that Diogenes
      the Cynic refuted the argument by getting up and walking. But I do
      not so construe the scope of his argument. He did not deny motion
      as a fact. It rested with him on the evidence of sense,
      acknowledged by every one. It was therefore only a phenomenal fact
      relative to our consciousness, sensation, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page103" id="v1page103"></a>103</span>movements, and
      comparisons. As such, but as such only, did Zeno acknowledge it.
      What he denied was, motion as a fact belonging to the Absolute, or
      as deducible from the Absolute. He did not deny the Absolute or
      Thing in itself, as an existing object, but he struck out variety,
      divisibility, and motion, from the list of its predicates. He
      admitted only the Parmenidean Ens, one, continuous, unchanged, and
      immovable, with none but negative predicates, and severed from the
      relative world of experience and sensation. </p>

    <p>Other reasoners, contemporary with Zeno, did not agree with him,
      in admitting the Absolute, even as an object with no predicates,
      except unity and continuity. They denied it altogether, both as
      substratum and as predicate. To establish this negation is the
      purpose of a short treatise ascribed to the rhetor or Sophist
      Gorgias, a contemporary of Zeno; but we are informed that all the
      reasonings, which Gorgias employed, were advanced, or had already

        often unintelligible.</p>
    </div>
    <p>As to the first point, Ens was no more real or existent than
      Non-Ens: the word Non-Ens must have an objective meaning, as well
      as the word Ens: it was Non-Ens, therefore it <i>was</i>, or
      existed. Both of them existed alike, or rather neither of them
      existed. Moreover, if Ens existed, it must exist either as One or
      as Many &#8212; either as eternal or as generated &#8212; either in itself, or
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page104" id="v1page104"></a>104</span>in



      some other place. But Melissus, Zeno, and other previous
      philosophers, had shown sufficient cause against each of these
      alternatives separately taken. Each of the alternative essential
      predicates had been separately disproved; therefore the subject,
      Ens, could not exist under either of them, or could not exist at
      all. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_2_24"
          id="Sidenotev1_2_24"></a>Ens, incogitable and unknowable.</span>
    </p>
    <p>As to the second point, let us grant that Ens or Entia exist;
      they would nevertheless (argued Gorgias) be incogitable and
      unknowable. To be cogitated is no more an attribute of Ens than of
      Non-Ens. The fact of cogitation does not require Ens as a
      condition, or attest Ens as an absolute or thing in itself. If our
      cogitation required or attained Ens as an indispensable object,
      then there could be no fictitious <i>cogitata</i> nor any false
      propositions. We think of a man flying in the air, or of a chariot
      race on the surface of the sea. If our <i>cogitata</i> were
      realities, these must be so as well as the rest: if realities
      alone were the object of cogitation, then these could not be
      thought of. As Non-Ens was thus undeniably the object of
      cogitation, so Ens could not be its object: for what was true
      respecting one of these contraries, could not be true respecting
      the other. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_2_25"
          id="Sidenotev1_2_25"></a>Ens, even if granted to be knowable,
        is still incommunicable to others. </span></p>
    <p>As to the third point: Assuming Ens both to exist and to be known
      by you, you cannot (said Gorgias) declare or explain it to any one
      else. You profess to have learnt what Ens is in itself, by your
      sight or other perceptions but you declare to others by means of
      words, and these words are neither themselves the absolute Ens,
      nor do they bring Ens before the hearer. Even though you yourself
      know Ens, you cannot, by your words, enable <i>him</i> to know
      it. If he is to know Ens, he must know it in the same way as you.
      Moreover, neither your words, nor Ens itself, will convey to the
      hearer the same knowledge as to you; for the same cannot be at
      once in two distinct subjects; and even if it were, yet since you
      and the hearer are not completely alike, so the effect of the same
      object on both of you will not appear to be like.<a

        In this third branch of the argument, showing that Ens, even if
        known, cannot be communicable to others, Gorgias travels beyond
        the Absolute, and directs his reasoning against the
        communicability of the Relative or Phenomenal also. Both of his
        arguments against such communicability have some foundation, and
        serve to prove that the communicability cannot be exact or
        entire, even in the case of sensible facts. The sensations
        thoughts, emotions, &amp;c., of one person are not <i>exactly</i>
        like those of another.</p>
    </div>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page105" id="v1page105"></a>105</span></p>
    <p>Such is the reasoning, as far as we can make it out, whereby
      Gorgias sought to prove that the absolute Ens was neither
      existent, nor knowable, nor communicable by words from one person
      to another. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_2_26"></a>Zeno and Gorgias &#8212; contrasted with
        the earlier Grecian philosophers. </span></p>
    <p>The arguments both of Zeno and of Gorgias (the latter presenting
      the thoughts of others earlier than himself), dating from a time
      coinciding with the younger half of the life of Sokrates, evince a
      new spirit and purpose in Grecian philosophy, as compared with the
      Ionians, the two first Eleates, and the Pythagoreans. Zeno and
      Gorgias exhibit conspicuously the new element of dialectic: the
      force of the negative arm in Grecian philosophy, brought out into
      the arena, against those who dogmatized or propounded positive
      theories: the fertility of Grecian imagination in suggesting
      doubts and difficulties, for which the dogmatists, if they aspired
      to success and reputation, had to provide answers. Zeno directed
      his attack against one scheme of philosophy &#8212; the doctrine of the
      Absolute Many: leaving by implication the rival doctrine &#8212; the
      Absolute One of Parmenides in exclusive possession of the field,
      yet not reinforcing it with any new defences against objectors.
      Gorgias impugned the philosophy of the Absolute in either or both
      of its forms &#8212; as One or as Many: not with a view of leaving any
      third form as the only survivor, or of providing any substitute
      from his own invention, but of showing that Ens, the object of
      philosophical research, could neither be found nor known. The
      negative purpose, disallowing altogether the philosophy of Nature
      (as then conceived, not as now conceived), was declared without
      reserve by Gorgias, as we shall presently find that it was by
      Sokrates also. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_2_27"
          id="Sidenotev1_2_27"></a>New character of Grecian philosophy &#8212;
        antithesis of affirmative and negative &#8212; proof and disproof. </span></p>
    <p>It is the opening of the negative vein which imparts from this
      time forward a new character to Grecian philosophy. The positive
      and negative forces, emanating from different aptitudes in the
      human mind, are now both of them actively developed, and in
      strenuous antithesis <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page106"
          id="v1page106"></a>106</span>to each other. Philosophy is no
      longer exclusively confined to dogmatists, each searching in his
      imagination for the Absolute Ens of Nature, and each propounding
      what seems to him the only solution of the problem. Such thinkers
      still continue their vocation, but under new conditions of
      success, and subject to the scrutiny of numerous dissentient
      critics. It is no longer sufficient to propound a theory,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_2_33" href="#Footnotev1_2_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
      either in obscure, oracular metaphors and half-intelligible
      aphorisms, like Herakleitus &#8212; or in verse more or less impressive,
      like Parmenides or Empedokles. The theory must be sustained by
      proofs, guarded against objections, defended against imputations
      of inconsistency: moreover, it must be put in comparison with
      other rival theories, the defects of which must accordingly be
      shown up along with it. Here are new exigencies, to which dogmatic
      philosophers had not before been obnoxious. They were now required
      to be masters of the art of dialectic attack and defence, not
      fearing the combat of question and answer &#8212; a combat in which,
      assuming tolerable equality between the duellists, the questioner
      had the advantage of the sun, or the preferable position,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_2_34" href="#Footnotev1_2_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
      and the farther advantage of choosing where to aim his blows. To
      expose fallacy or inconsistency, was found to be both an easier
      process, and a more appreciable display of ingenuity, than the
      discovery and establishment of truth in such manner as to command
      assent. The weapon of negation, refutation, cross-examination, was
      wielded for its own results, and was found hard to parry by the
      affirmative philosophers of the day. </p>

        The repugnance of the Herakleitean philosophers to the scrutiny
        of dialectical interrogation is described by Plato in strong
        language, it is indeed even caricatured. (The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,

    <p class="center">APPENDIX. </p>
    <p>To illustrate by comparison the form of Grecian philosophy,
      before Dialectic was brought to bear upon it, I transcribe from
      two eminent French scholars (M. Barth&eacute;lemy St. Hilaire and
      Professor Robert Mohl) some account of the mode in which the
      Indian philosophy has always been kept on record and communicated.
    </p>
    <p>M. Barth&eacute;lemy St. Hilaire (in his Premier M&eacute;moire
      sur le S&acirc;nkhya, pp. 5-11) gives the following observations
      upon the S&acirc;nkhya or philosophy of Kapila, one of the
      principal systems of Sanskrit philosophy: date (as supposed) about
      700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> </p>
    <p>There are two sources from whence the S&acirc;nkhya philosophy is
      known:&#8212; </p>
    <p>&#8220;1. Les So&ucirc;tras ou aphorismes de Kapila. </p>
    <p>&#8220;2. Le trait&eacute; d&eacute;j&agrave; connu et traduit sous le
      nom de S&acirc;nkhya K&acirc;rik&acirc;, c&#8217;est &agrave; dire Vers
      M&eacute;moriaux du S&acirc;nkhya. </p>
    <p>&#8220;Les So&ucirc;tras de Kapila sont en tout au nombre de 499,
      divis&eacute;s en six lectures, et r&eacute;partis
      in&eacute;galement entre chacune d&#8217;elles. Les So&ucirc;tras sont
      accompagn&eacute;s d&#8217;un commentaire qui les explique, et qui est
      d&#8217;un brahmane nomm&eacute; le Mendiant. Le commentateur explique
      avec des developpements plus ou moins longs les So&ucirc;tras de
      Kapila, qu&#8217;il cite un &agrave; un. </p>
    <p>&#8220;Les So&ucirc;tras sont en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral tres concis:
      parfois ils ne se composent que de deux ou trois mots, et jamais
      ils ne comprennent plus d&#8217;une phrase. Cette forme aphoristique,
      sous laquelle se pr&eacute;sente &agrave; nous la philosophie
      Indienne &#8212; est celle qu&#8217;a prise la science Indienne dans toutes
      ses branches, depuis la grammaire jusqu&#8217;&agrave; la philosophie.
      Les So&ucirc;tras de Panini, qui a r&eacute;duit toutes les
      r&eacute;gles de la grammaire sanscrite en 3996 aphorismes, ne
      sont pas moins concis que ceux de Kapila. Ce mode &eacute;trange
      d&#8217;exposition tient dans l&#8217;Inde &agrave; la mani&egrave;re
      m&ecirc;me dont la science s&#8217;est transmise d&#8217;&acirc;ge en
      &acirc;ge. Un ma&icirc;tre n&#8217;a g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement qu&#8217;un
      disciple: il lui suffit, pour la doctrine qu&#8217;il communique,
      d&#8217;avoir des points de rep&egrave;re, et le commentaire oral qu&#8217;il
      ajoute<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page108" id="v1page108"></a>108</span>
      &agrave; ces sentences pour leur expliquer, met le disciple en
      &eacute;tat de les bien comprendre. Le disciple lui-m&ecirc;me,
      une fois qu&#8217;il en a p&eacute;n&eacute;tr&eacute; le sens
      veritable, n&#8217;a pas besoin d&#8217;un symbole plus
      d&eacute;velopp&eacute;, et la concision m&ecirc;me des aphorismes
      l&#8217;aide a les mieux retenir. <i>C&#8217;est une initiation qu&#8217;il a
        re&ccedil;ue: et les sentences, dans lesquelles cette initiation
        se r&eacute;sume, restent toujours assez claires pour lui.</i> </p>
    <p>&#8220;Mais il n&#8217;en est pas de m&ecirc;me pour les lecteurs
      &eacute;trangers, et il serait difficile de trouver rien de plus
      obscur que ces So&ucirc;tras. Les commentaires m&ecirc;mes ne
      suffisent pas toujours &agrave; les rendre parfaitement
      intelligibles. </p>
    <p>&#8220;Le seul exemple d&#8217;une forme analogue dans l&#8217;histoire de l&#8217;esprit
      humain et de la science en Occident, nous est fourni par les
      Aphorismes d&#8217;Hippocrate: eux aussi s&#8217;adressaient &agrave; des
      adeptes, et ils r&eacute;clamaient, comme les So&ucirc;tras
      Indiens, l&#8217;explication des ma&icirc;tres pour &ecirc;tre bien
      compris par les disciples. Mais cet exemple unique n&#8217;a point
      tir&eacute; &agrave; cons&eacute;quence dans le monde occidental,
      tandis que dans le monde Indien l&#8217;aphorisme est rest&eacute;
      pendant de longs si&egrave;cles la forme sp&eacute;ciale de la
      science: et les d&eacute;veloppements de pens&eacute;e qui nous
      sont habituels, et qui nous semblent indispensables, ont
      &eacute;t&eacute; reserv&eacute;s aux commentaires. </p>
    <p>&#8220;La S&acirc;nkhya K&acirc;rik&acirc; est en vers: En
      Gr&egrave;ce, la po&eacute;sie a &eacute;t&eacute; pendant quelque
      temps la langue de la philosophie; Emp&eacute;docle,
      Parm&eacute;nide, ont &eacute;crit leurs syst&egrave;mes en vers.
      Ce n&#8217;est pas Kapila qui l&#8217;a &eacute;crite. Entre Kapila, et
      l&#8217;auteur de la K&acirc;rik&acirc;, Isvara Krishna, on doit compter
      quelques centaines d&#8217;ann&eacute;es tout au moins: et le second n&#8217;a
      fait que rediger en vers, pour aider la m&eacute;moire des
      &eacute;l&egrave;ves, la doctrine que le ma&icirc;tre avait
      laiss&eacute;e sous la forme axiomatique. </p>
    <p>&#8220;On con&ccedil;oit, du reste, sans peine, que l&#8217;usage des vers
      m&eacute;moriaux se soit introduit dans l&#8217;Inde pour l&#8217;enseignement
      et la transmission de la science: c&#8217;&eacute;tait une
      cons&eacute;quence n&eacute;cessaire de l&#8217;usage des aphorismes.
      Les sciences les plus abstraites (mathematics, astronomy,
      algebra), emploient aussi ce proc&eacute;d&eacute;, quoiqu&#8217;il
      semble peu fait pour leur aust&eacute;rit&eacute; et leur
      precision. Ainsi, le rhythme est, avec les aphorismes, et par le
      m&ecirc;me motif, la forme &agrave; peu pres
      g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la science dans l&#8217;Inde.&#8221; </p>
    <p>(Kapila as a personage is almost legendary; nothing exact is
      known about him. His doctrine passes among the Indians &#8220;comme une
      sorte de r&eacute;v&eacute;lation divine&#8221;. &#8212; Pp. 252, 253.) </p>
    <p>M. Mohl observes as follows:&#8212; </p>
    <p>&#8220;Ceci m&#8217;am&egrave;ne aux Pouranas. Nous n&#8217;avons plus rien du
      Pourana primitif, qui para&icirc;t avoir &eacute;t&eacute; une
      cosmogonie, suivie d&#8217;une histoire des Dieux et des families
      h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques. Les sectes ont fini par s&#8217;approprier <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page109" id="v1page109"></a>109</span>ce



      cadre, apr&egrave;s des transformations dont nous ne savons ni le
      nombre ni les &eacute;poques: et s&#8217;en sont servies, pour exalter
      chacune son dieu, et y fondre, avec des d&eacute;bris de
      l&#8217;ancienne tradition, leur mythologie plus moderne. Ce que les
      Pouranas sont pour le peuple, les six syst&egrave;mes de
      philosophie le sont pour les savants. Nous trouvons ces
      syst&egrave;mes dans la forme abstruse que les Hindous aiment
      &agrave; donner &agrave; leur science: chaque &eacute;cole a ses
      aphorismes, qui, sous forme de vers mn&eacute;moniques,
      contiennent dans le moins grand nombre de mots possible tous les
      r&eacute;sultats d&#8217;une &eacute;cole. Mais nous n&#8217;avons aucun
      renseignement sur les commencements de l&#8217;&eacute;cole, sur les
      discussions que l&#8217;&eacute;laboration du syst&egrave;me a d&ucirc;
      provoquer, sur les hommes qui y ont pris part, sur la marche et le
      d&eacute;veloppement des id&eacute;es: nous avons le
      syst&egrave;me dans sa derni&egrave;re forme, et rien ne nous
      permet de remplir l&#8217;espace qui le s&eacute;pare des
      th&eacute;ories plus vagues que l&#8217;on trouve dans les derniers
      &eacute;crits de l&#8217;&eacute;poque v&eacute;dique, &agrave; laquelle
      pourtant tout pr&eacute;tend se rattacher. &Agrave; partir de ces
      aphorismes, nous avons des commentaires et des trait&eacute;s
      d&#8217;exposition et d&#8217;interpr&eacute;tation: mais les id&eacute;es
      premi&egrave;res, les termes techniques, et le systeme en tier,
      sont fix&eacute;s ant&eacute;rieurement. Tous ces syst&egrave;mes
      reposent sur une analyse psychologique tr&egrave;s
      raffin&eacute;e; et chacun a sa terminologie pr&eacute;cise, et
      &agrave; laquelle la n&ocirc;tre ne r&eacute;pond que fort
      imparfaitement: il faut donc, sous peine de se tromper et de
      tromper ses lecteurs, que les traducteurs cr&eacute;ent une foule
      de termes techniques, ce qui n&#8217;est pas la moindre
      difficult&eacute; de ce travail.&#8221; R. Mohl, &#8216;Rapport Annuel Fait
      &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; As&iuml;atique,&#8217; 1863, pp.

    <p>When the purpose simply is to imprint affirmations on the memory,
      and to associate them with strong emotions of reverential belief &#8212;
      mnemonic verses and aphorisms are suitable enough; Empedokles
      employed verse, Herakleitus and the Pythagoreans expressed
      themselves in aphorisms &#8212; brief, half-intelligible, impressive
      symbols. But if philosophy is ever to be brought out of such
      twilight into the condition of &#8220;reasoned truth,&#8221; this cannot be
      done without submitting all the affirmations to cross-examining
      opponents &#8212; to the scrutiny of a negative Dialectic. It is the
      theory and application of this Dialectic which we are about to
      follow in Sokrates and Plato. </p>

    <p>The ascendancy of Sokrates over his contemporaries was powerfully
      exercised in more than one way. He brought into vogue new subjects
      both of indefinite amplitude, and familiar as well as interesting
      to every one. On these subjects, moreover, he introduced, or at
      least popularised, a new method of communication, whereby the
      relation of teacher and learner, implying a direct transfer of
      ready-made knowledge from the one to the other, was put aside. He
      substituted an interrogatory process, at once destructive and
      suggestive, in which the teacher began by unteaching and the
      learner by unlearning what was supposed to be already known, for
      the purpose of provoking in the learner&#8217;s mind a self-operative
      energy of thought, and an internal generation of new notions.
      Lastly, Sokrates worked forcibly upon the minds of several <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page111" id="v1page111"></a>111</span>friends,



      who were in the habit of attending him when he talked in the
      market-place or the pal&aelig;stra. Some tried to copy his
      wonderful knack of colloquial cross-examination: how far they did
      so with success or reputation we do not know: but Xenophon says
      that several of them would only discourse with those who paid them
      a fee, and that they thus sold for considerable sums what were
      only small fragments obtained gratuitously from the rich table of
      their master.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_2" href="#Footnotev1_3_2"><span
          class="sp">2</span></a> There were moreover several who copied
      the general style of his colloquies by composing written
      dialogues. And thus it happened that the great master, &#8212; he who
      passed his life in the oral application of his Elenchus, without
      writing anything, &#8212; though he left no worthy representative in his
      own special career, became the father of numerous written
      dialogues and of a rich philosophical literature.<a

        We find a remarkable proof how long the name and conception of
        Sokrates lasted in the memory of the Athenian public, as having
        been the great progenitor of the philosophy and philosophers of
        the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> in Athens.
        It was about 306 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, almost a
        century after the death of Sokrates, that Demochar&ecirc;s (the
        nephew of the orator Demosthenes) delivered an oration before
        the Athenian judicature for the purpose of upholding the law
        proposed by Sophokles, forbidding philosophers or Sophists to
        lecture without a license obtained from the government; which
        law, passed a year before, had determined the secession of all
        the philosophers from Athens until the law was repealed. In this
        oration Demochar&ecirc;s expatiated on the demerits of many
        philosophers, their servility, profligate ambition, rapacity,
        want of patriotism, &amp;c., from which Athen&aelig;us makes
        several extracts. &#932;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962;

        the interest in the personal fate and character of Sokrates

    <p>Besides Plato and Xenophon, whose works are known to us, we hear
      of Alexamenus, Antisthenes, &AElig;schines, Aristippus, Bryson,
      Eukleides, Ph&aelig;don, Kriton, Simmias, Keb&ecirc;s, &amp;c., as
      having composed dialogues of this sort. All of them were
      companions of Sokrates; several among them either set down what
      they could partially recollect of his conversations, or employed
      his name as a dramatic speaker of their own thoughts. Seven of
      these dialogues were ascribed to &AElig;schines, twenty-five to
      Aristippus, seventeen to Kriton, twenty-three to Simmias, three to
      Keb&ecirc;s, six to Eukleides, four to Ph&aelig;don. The
      compositions of Antisthenes were far more numerous: ten <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page112" id="v1page112"></a>112</span>volumes



      of them, under a variety of distinct titles (some of them probably
      not in the form of dialogues) being recorded by Diogenes.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_4" href="#Footnotev1_3_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
      Aristippus was the first of the line of philosophers called
      Kyrenaic or Hedonic, afterwards (with various modifications)
      Epikurean: Antisthenes, of the Cynics and Stoics: Eukleides, of
      the Megaric school. It seems that Aristippus, Antisthenes,
      Eukleides, and Bryson, all enjoyed considerable reputation, as
      contemporaries and rival authors of Plato: &AElig;schines,
      Antisthenes (who was very poor), and Aristippus, are said to have
      received money for their lectures; Aristippus being named as the
      first who thus departed from the Sokratic canon.<a

        Diogenes Laert. 1. 47-61-83, vi. 15; Athen&aelig;. xi. p. 505 C.
      </p>
      <p>Bryson is mentioned by Theopompus ap. Athen&aelig;um, xi. p.
        508 D. Theopompus, the contemporary of Aristotle and pupil of
        Isokrates, had composed an express treatise or discourse against
        Plato&#8217;s dialogues, in which discourse he affirmed that most of
        them were not Plato&#8217;s own, but borrowed in large proportion from
        the dialogues of Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Bryson. Ephippus
        also, the comic writer (of the fourth century <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>, contemporary with Theopompus,
        perhaps even earlier), spoke of Bryson as contemporary with
        Plato (Athen&aelig;. xi. 509 C). This is good proof to
        authenticate Bryson as a composer of &#8220;Sokratic dialogues&#8221;
        belonging to the Platonic age, along with Antisthenes and
        Aristippus: whether Theopompus is correct when he asserts that
        Plato borrowed <i>much</i>, from the three, is very doubtful. </p>
      <p>Many dialogues were published by various writers, and ascribed
        falsely to one or other of the <i>viri Sokratici</i>: Diogenes
        (ii. 64) reports the judgment delivered by Pan&aelig;tius, which
        among them were genuine and which not so. Pan&aelig;tius
        considered that the dialogues ascribed to Plato, Xenophon,
        Antisthenes, and &AElig;schines, were genuine; that those
        assigned to Ph&aelig;don and Eukleides were doubtful; and that
        the rest were all spurious. He thus regarded as spurious those
        of Alexamenus, Kriton, Simmias, Keb&ecirc;s, Simon, Bryson,
        &amp;c., or he did not know them all. It is possible that
        Pan&aelig;tius may not have known the dialogues of Bryson; if he
        did know them and believed them to be spurious, I should not
        accept his assertion, because I think that it is outweighed by
        the contrary testimony of Theopompus. Moreover, though
        Pan&aelig;tius was a very able man, confidence in his critical
        estimate is much shaken when we learn that he declared the
        Platonic Ph&aelig;don to be spurious.</p>

        Diogen. Laert. i. 62-65; Athen&aelig;us, xi. p. 507 C. </p>
      <p>Dion Chrysostom (Orat. lv. De Homero et Socrate, vol. ii. p.
        289, Reiske) must have had in his view some of these other
        Sokratic dialogues, not those composed by Plato or Xenophon,
        when he alludes to conversations of Sokrates with Lysikles,
        Glykon, and Anytus; what he says about Anytus can hardly refer
        to the Platonic Menon.</p>

        against him. </span></p>
    <p>&AElig;schines the companion of Sokrates did not become (like
      Eukleides, Antisthenes, Aristippus) the founder of a succession or
      sect of philosophers. The few fragments remaining of his dialogues
      do not enable us to appreciate their merit. He seems to have
      employed the name of Aspasia largely as a conversing personage,
      and to have esteemed her highly. He also spoke with great
      admiration of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page113"
          id="v1page113"></a>113</span>Themistokles. But in regard to
      present or recent characters, he stands charged with much
      bitterness and ill-nature: especially we learn that he denounced
      the Sophists Prodikus and Anaxaras, the first on the ground of
      having taught Theramenes, the second as the teacher of two
      worthless persons &#8212; Ariphrades and Arign&ocirc;tus. This
      accusation deserves greater notice, because it illustrates the
      odium raised by Mel&ecirc;tus against Sokrates as having
      instructed Kritias and Alkibiades.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_6"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Moreover,
      we have &AElig;schines presented to us in another character, very
      unexpected in a <i>vir Socraticus</i>. An action for recovery of
      money alleged to be owing was brought in the Athenian Dikastery
      against &AElig;schines, by a plaintiff, who set forth his case in
      a speech composed by the rhetor Lysias. In this speech it is
      alleged that &AElig;schines, having engaged in trade as a preparer
      and seller of unguents, borrowed a sum of money at interest from
      the plaintiff; who affirms that he counted with assurance upon
      honest dealing from a disciple of Sokrates, continually engaged in
      talking about justice and virtue.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_7"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> But so far
      was this expectation from being realized, that &AElig;schines had
      behaved most dishonestly. He repaid neither principal nor
      interest; though a judgment of the Dikastery had been obtained
      against him, and a branded slave belonging to him had been seized
      under it. Moreover, &AElig;schines had been guilty of dishonesty
      equally scandalous in his dealings with many other creditors also.
      Furthermore, he had made love to a rich woman seventy years old,
      and had got possession of her property; cheating and impoverishing
      her family. His character as a profligate and cheat was well known
      and could be proved by many <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page114" id="v1page114"></a>114</span>witnesses. Such
      are the allegations against &AElig;schines, contained in the
      fragment of a lost speech of Lysias, and made in open court by a
      real plaintiff. How much of them could be fairly proved, we cannot
      say: but it seems plain at least that &AElig;schines must have
      been a trader as well as a philosopher. All these writers on
      philosophy must have had their root and dealings in real life, of
      which we know scarce anything. </p>

      main features: his proclaimed confession of ignorance was seldom
      wanting: and the humiliation which his cross-questioning inflicted
      even upon insolent men like Alkibiades, was as keenly set forth by
      &AElig;schines as by Plato: moreover the Sokratic disciples
      generally were fond of extolling the D&aelig;mon or divining
      prophecy of their master.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_9"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> Some
      dialogues circulating under the name of some one among the
      companions of Sokrates, were spurious, and the authorship was a
      point not easy to determine. Simon, a currier at Athens, in whose
      shop Sokrates often conversed, is said to have kept memoranda of
      the conversations which he heard, and to have afterwards published
      them: &AElig;schines also, and some other of the Sokratic
      companions, were suspected of having preserved or procured reports
      of the conversations of the master himself, and of having made
      much money after his death by delivering them before select
      audiences.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_10" href="#Footnotev1_3_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> Aristotle speaks of the followers of
      Antisthenes as unschooled, vulgar men: but Cicero appears to have
      read with satisfaction the dialogues of Antisthenes, whom he
      designates as acute though not well-instructed.<a

      Other accounts describe his dialogues as composed in a rhetorical
      style, which is ascribed to the fact of his having received
      lessons from Gorgias:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_12"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> and

      <p>Lucian, Hermogenes, Phrynichus, Longinus, and some later
        rhetorical critics of Greece judged more favourably than Timon
        about the style of &AElig;schines as well as of Xenophon. See
        Zeller, Phil. d. Griech. ii. p. 171, sec. ed. And Demetrius
        Phalereus (or the author of the treatise which bears his name),
        as well as the rhetor Aristeides, considered &AElig;schines and
        Plato as the best representatives of the &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#967;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#942;&#961;,

        passed some time with the elder Dionysius at Syracuse, to whom
        he read aloud his dialogue, entitled Miltiades, with great
        success. </p>
      <p>An inedited discourse of Mich&aelig;l Psellus, printed by Mr.
        Cox in his very careful and valuable catalogue of the MSS. in
        the Bodleian Library, recites the same high estimate as having
        been formed of &AElig;schines by the chief ancient rhetorical
        critics: they reckoned him among and alongside of the foremost
        Hellenic classical writers, as having his own peculiar merits of
        style &#8212; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#953;, &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8052;&#957; &#966;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#8166;

        speaks of the Sokratic philosophers generally, as writing with
        an elegant playfulness of style (De Officiis, i. 29, 104): which
        is in harmony with Lucian&#8217;s phrase &#8212; &#913;&#7984;&#963;&#967;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#8001; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#962;

        that some of the dialogues composed by &AElig;schines were
        mistaken by various persons for actual conversations held by
        Sokrates. It was argued, that because &AElig;schines was
        inferior to Plato in ability, he was more likely to have
        repeated accurately what he had heard Sokrates say.</p>

        dialogues in one volume, purporting to be reports of real
        colloquies of Sokrates, published by Simon. But they can hardly
        be regarded as genuine. </p>
      <p>The charge here mentioned is advanced by Xenophon (see a

        Cicero, Epist. ad Atticum, xii. 38:&#8212;&#8220;viri acuti magis quam
        eruditi,&#8221; is the judgment of Cicero upon Antisthenes. I presume
        that these words indicate the same defect as that which is
        intended by Aristotle when he says &#8212; &#959;&#7985; &#7944;&#957;&#952;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#7985;

        p. 1043, b. 24. It is plain, too, that Lucian considered the
        compositions of Antisthenes as not unworthy companions to those
        of Plato (Lucian, adv. Indoctum, c. 27).</p>

        Diogen. Laert. vi. 1. If it be true that Antisthenes received
        lessons from Gorgias, this proves that Gorgias must sometimes
        have given lessons <i>gratis</i>; for the poverty of
        Antisthenes is well known. See the Symposion of Xenophon.</p>

        Sokrates &#8212; Their proceedings after the death of Sokrates. </span></p>
    <p>Eukleides, Antisthenes, and Aristippus, were all companions and
      admirers of Sokrates, as was Plato. But none of them were his
      disciples, in the strict sense of the word: none of them continued
      or enforced his doctrines, though each used his name as a
      spokesman. During his lifetime the common attachment to his person
      formed a bond of union, which ceased at his death. There is indeed
      some ground for believing that Plato then put himself forward in
      the character of leader, with a view to keep the body united.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_14" href="#Footnotev1_3_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
      We must recollect that Plato though then no more than twenty-eight
      years of age, was the only one among them who combined the
      advantages of a noble Athenian descent, opulent circumstances, an
      excellent education, and great native genius. Eukleides and
      Aristippus were neither of them Athenians: Antisthenes was very
      poor: Xenophon was absent on service in the Cyreian army. Plato&#8217;s
      proposition, however, found no favour with the others and was even
      indignantly repudiated by Apollodorus: a man ardently attached to
      Sokrates, but violent and overboiling in all his feelings.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_15" href="#Footnotev1_3_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
      The companions of Sokrates, finding themselves unfavourably looked
      upon at Athens after his death, left the city for a season and
      followed Eukleides to Megara. How long they stayed there we do not
      know. Plato is said, though I think on no sufficient authority, to
      have remained absent from Athens for several years continuously.
      It seems certain (from an anecdote recounted by Aristotle)<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_16" href="#Footnotev1_3_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
      that he talked with something like <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page117" id="v1page117"></a>117</span>arrogance among
      the companions of Sokrates: and that Aristippus gently rebuked him
      by reminding him how very different had been the language of
      Sokrates himself. Complaints too were made by contemporaries,
      about Plato&#8217;s jealous, censorious, spiteful, temper. The critical
      and disparaging tone of his dialogues, notwithstanding the
      admiration which they inspire, accounts for the existence of these
      complaints: and anecdotes are recounted, though not verified by
      any sufficient evidence, of ill-natured dealing on his part
      towards other philosophers who were poorer than himself.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_17" href="#Footnotev1_3_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
      Dissension or controversy on philosophical topics is rarely
      carried on without some invidious or hostile feeling. Athens, and
      the <i>viri Sokratici</i>, Plato included, form no exception to
      this ordinary malady of human nature. </p>

        his school was probably at Megara, seems to have possessed

    <p>It is common for historians of philosophy to speak of a Sokratic
      school: but this phrase, if admissible at all, is only admissible
      in the largest and vaguest sense. The effect produced by Sokrates
      upon his companions was, not to teach doctrine, but to stimulate
      self-working enquiry, upon ethical and social subjects. Eukleides,
      Antisthenes, Aristippus, each took a line of his own, not less
      decidedly than Plato. But unfortunately we have no compositions
      remaining from either of the three. We possess only brief reports
      respecting some leading points of their doctrine, emanating
      altogether from those who disagreed with it: we have besides
      aphorisms, dicta, repartees, bons-mots, &amp;c., which they are
      said to have uttered. Of these many are evident inventions; some
      proceeding from opponents and probably coloured or exaggerated,
      others hardly authenticated at all. But if they were ever so well
      authenticated, they would form very insufficient evidence on which
      to judge a philosopher &#8212; much less <span class="pagenum"><a

      observed) aspires to deliver not merely truth, but reasoned truth.
      We ought to know not only what doctrines a philosopher maintained,
      but how he maintained them:&#8212;what objections others made against
      him, and how he replied:&#8212;what objections he made against
      dissentient doctrines, and what replies were made to him.
      Respecting Plato and Aristotle, we possess such information to a
      considerable extent:&#8212;respecting Eukleides, Antisthenes, and

        Respecting these ancient philosophers, whose works are lost, I
        transcribe a striking passage from Descartes, who complains, in
        his own case, of the injustice of being judged from the
        statements of others, and not from his own writings:&#8212;&#8220;Quod adeo

        Parmenides with Sokrates. </span></p>
    <p>Eukleides was a Parmenidean, who blended the ethical point of
      view of Sokrates with the ontology of Parmenides, and followed out
      that negative Dialectic which was common to Sokrates with Zeno.
      Parmenides (I have with already said)<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_19"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> and Zeno
      after him, recognised no absolute reality except Ens Unum,
      continuous, indivisible: they denied all real plurality: they said
      that the plural was Non-Ens or Nothing, <i>i.e.</i> nothing real
      or absolute, but only apparent, perpetually transient and
      changing, relative, different as appreciated by one man and by
      another. Now Sokrates laid it down that wisdom or knowledge of
      Good, was the sum total of ethical perfection, including within it
      all the different virtues: he spoke also about the divine wisdom
      inherent in, or pervad<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page119"
          id="v1page119"></a>119</span>ing the entire Kosmos or
      universe.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_20" href="#Footnotev1_3_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a> Eukleides blended together the Ens of
      Parmenides with the Good of Sokrates, saying that the two names
      designated one and the same thing: sometimes called Good, Wisdom,
      Intelligence, God, &amp;c., and by other names also, but always
      one and the same object named and meant. He farther maintained
      that the opposite of Ens, and the opposite of Bonum (Non-Ens,
      Non-Bonum, or Malum) were things non-existent, unmeaning names,
      Nothing,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_21" href="#Footnotev1_3_21"><span
          class="sp">21</span></a> &amp;c.: <i>i.e.</i> that they were
      nothing really, absolutely, permanently, but ever varying and
      dependent upon our ever varying conceptions. The One &#8212; the All &#8212;
      the Good &#8212; was absolute, immoveable, invariable, indivisible. But
      the opposite thereof was a non-entity or nothing: there was no one
      constant meaning corresponding to Non-Ens &#8212; but a variable
      meaning, different with every man who used it. </p>

    <p>It was in this manner that Eukleides solved the problem which
      Sokrates had brought into vogue &#8212; What is the Bonum &#8212; or (as
      afterwards phrased) the Summum Bonum? Eukleides pronounced the
      Bonum to be coincident with the Ens Unum of Parmenides. The

      or Ontology, became thus implicated with Transcendental Ethics.<a

        &#8212; changes in Plato. </span></p>
    <p>Plato departs from Sokrates on the same point. He agrees with
      Eukleides in recognising a Transcendental Bonum. But it appears
      that his doctrines on this head underwent some change. He held for
      some time what is called the doctrine of Ideas: transcendental
      Forms, Entia, Essences: he considered the Transcendental to be
      essentially multiple, or to be an aggregate &#8212; whereas Eukleides
      had regarded it as essentially One. This is <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page120" id="v1page120"></a>120</span>the doctrine
      which we find in some of the Platonic dialogues. In the Republic,
      the Idea of Good appears as one of these, though it is declared to
      be the foremost in rank and the most ascendant in efficacy.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_23" href="#Footnotev1_3_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
      But in the later part of his life, and in his lectures (as we
      learn from Aristotle), Plato came to adopt a different view. He
      resolved the Ideas into numbers. He regarded them as made up by
      the combination of two distinct factors:&#8212;1. The One &#8212; the
      Essentially One. 2. The Essentially Plural: The Indeterminate
      Dyad: the Great and Little. &#8212; Of these two elements he considered
      the Ideas to be compounded. And he identified the Idea of Good
      with the essentially One &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8056;&#957; with &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957;: the principle of
      Good with the principle of Unity: also the principle of Evil with
      the Indeterminate. But though Unity and Good were thus identical,
      he considered Unity as logically antecedent, or the subject &#8212; Good
      as logically consequent, or the predicate.<a

        held by Plato in his later years, appears in various passages of
        the Metaphysica, and in the curious account repeated by
        Aristoxenus (who had often heard it from Aristotle &#8212; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#962;

      <p>The account given by Zeller (Phil. der Griech. ii. p. 453, 2nd
        ed.) of this latter phase of the Platonic doctrine of Ideas,
        applies exactly to that which we hear about the main doctrine of
        Eukleides. Zeller describes the Platonic doctrine as being &#8220;Eine
        Vermischung des ethischen Begriffes vom h&ouml;chsten Gut, mit
        dem Metaphysischen des Absoluten: Der Begriff des Guten ist
        zun&auml;chst aus dem menschlichen Leben abstrahirt; er
        bezeichnet das, was dem Menschen zutr&auml;glich ist. So noch
        bei Sokrates. Plato verallgemeinert ihn nun zum Begriff des
        Absoluten; dabei spielt aber seine urspr&uuml;ngliche Bedeutung
        noch fortw&auml;hrend herein, und so entsteht die Unklarheit,
        dass weder der ethische noch der metaphysische Begriff des Guten
        rein gefasst wird.&#8221; </p>
      <p>This remark is not less applicable to Eukleides than to Plato,
        both of them agreeing in the doctrine here criticised. Zeller
        says truly, that the attempt to identify Unum and Bonum produces
        perpetual confusion. The two notions are thoroughly distinct and
        independent. It ought not to be called (as he phrases it) &#8220;a
        generalization of Bonum&#8221;. There is no common property on which
        to found a generalization. It is a forced conjunction between
        two disparates.</p>

        same as that of Eukleides. </span></p>
    <p>This last doctrine of Plato in his later years (which does not
      appear in the dialogues, but seems, as far as we can make out, to
      have been delivered substantially in his oral lectures, and is
      ascribed to him by Aristotle) was nearly coincident with that of
      Eukleides. Both held the identity of &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957; with &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;. This
      one doctrine is all that we know about Eukleides: what <span

      he derived from it, or whether any, we do not know. But Plato
      combined, with this transcendental Unum = Bonum, a transcendental
      indeterminate plurality: from which combination he considered his
      Ideas or Ideal Numbers to be derivatives. </p>

    <p>Eukleides is said to have composed six dialogues, the titles of
      which alone remain. The scanty information which we possess
      respecting him relates altogether to his negative logical
      procedure. Whether he deduced any consequences from his positive
      doctrine of the Transcendental Ens, Unum, Bonum, we do not know:
      but he, as Zeno had been before him,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_25"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> was acute
      in exposing contradictions and difficulties in the positive
      doctrines of opponents. He was a citizen of Megara, where he is
      said to have harboured Plato and the other companions of Sokrates,
      when they retired for a time from Athens after the death of
      Sokrates. Living there as a teacher or debater on philosophy, he
      founded a school or succession of philosophers who were
      denominated <i>Megarici</i>. The title is as old as Aristotle,
      who both names them and criticises their doctrines.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_26" href="#Footnotev1_3_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a>
      None of their compositions are preserved. The earliest who becomes
      known to us is Eubulides, the contemporary and opponent of
      Aristotle; next Ichthyas, Apollonius, Diod&ocirc;rus Kronus,
      Stilpon, Alexinus, between 340-260 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>

        Aristippus &#8212; Ethical, not transcendental. </span></p>
    <p>The Megarics and Eretrians, as far as we know them, turned their
      speculative activity altogether in the logical or intellectual
      direction, paying little attention to the ethical and emotional
      field. Both Antisthenes and Aristippus, on the contrary, pursued
      the ethical path. To the Sokratic question, What is the Bonum?
      Eukleides had answered by a transcendental definition: Antisthenes
      and Aristippus each gave to it an ethical answer, having reference
      to human wants and emotions, and to the different views which they
      respectively took thereof. Antisthenes declared it to consist in
      virtue, by which he meant an independent and self-sufficing
      character, confining all wants within the narrowest limits:
      Aristippus placed it in the moderate and easy pleasures, in
      avoiding ambitious struggles, and in making the best of every
      different situation, yet always under the guidance of a wise
      calculation and self-command. Both of them kept clear of the
      transcendental: they neither accepted it as Unum et Omne (the view
      of Eukleides), nor as Plura (the Eternal Ideas or Forms, the
      Platonic view). Their speculations had reference altogether to
      human life and feelings, though the one took a measure of this
      wide subject very different from the other: and in thus confining
      the range of their speculations, they followed Sokrates more
      closely than either Eukleides or Plato followed him. They not only
      abstained from transcendental speculation, but put themselves in
      declared opposition to it. And since the intellectual or logical
      philosophy, as treated by Plato, became intimately blended with
      transcendental hypothesis &#8212; Antisthenes and Aristippus are both
      found on the negative side against its pretensions. Aristippus
      declared the mathematical sciences to be useless, as conducing in
      no way to happiness, and taking no account of what was better or
      what was worse.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_27" href="#Footnotev1_3_27"><span

    <p>Such were the leading writers and talkers contemporary with
      Plato, in the dialectical age immediately following on the death
      of Sokrates. The negative vein greatly preponderates in them, as
      it does on the whole even in Plato &#8212; and as it was pretty sure to
      do, so long as the form of dialogue was employed. Affirmative
      exposition and proof is indeed found in some of the later Platonic
      works, carried on by colloquy between two speakers. But the
      colloquial form manifests itself evidently as unsuitable for the
      purpose: and we must remember that Plato was a lecturer as well as
      a writer, so that his doctrines made their way, at least in part,
      through continuous exposition. But it is Aristotle with whom the
      form of affirmative continuous exposition first becomes
      predominant, in matters of philosophy. Though he composed
      dialogues (which are now lost), and though he appreciates
      dialectic as a valuable exercise, yet he considers it only as a
      discursive preparation; antecedent, though essential, to the more
      close and concentrated demonstrations of philosophy. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_3_14"></a>Harsh manner in which historians of
        philosophy censure the negative vein.</span> </p>
    <p>Most historians deal hardly with this negative vein. They
      depreciate the Sophists, the Megarics and Eretrians, the Academics
      and Sceptics of the subsequent ages &#8212; under the title of Eristics,
      or lovers of contention for itself &#8212; as captious and perverse
      enemies of truth. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_3_15"></a>Negative method in philosophy
        essential to the controul of the affirmative. </span></p>
    <p>I have already said that my view of the importance and value of
      the negative vein of philosophy is altogether different. It
      appears to me quite as essential as the affirmative. It is
      required as an antecedent, a test, and a corrective. Aristotle
      deserves all honour for his attempts to construct and defend
      various affirmative theories: but the value of these theories
      depends upon their being defensible against all objectors.
      Affirmative philosophy, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page124"
          id="v1page124"></a>124</span>as a body not only of truth but
      of reasoned truth, holds the champion&#8217;s belt, subject to the
      challenge not only of competing affirmants, but of all deniers and
      doubters. And this is the more indispensable, because of the vast
      problems which these affirmative philosophers undertake to solve:
      problems especially vast during the age of Plato and Aristotle.
      The question has to be determined, not only which of two proposed
      solutions is the best, but whether either of them is tenable, and
      even whether any solution at all is attainable by the human
      faculties: whether there exist positive evidence adequate to
      sustain any conclusion, accompanied with adequate replies to the
      objections against it. The burthen of proof lies upon the
      affirmant: and the proof produced must be open to the scrutiny of
      every dissentient. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_16"
          id="Sidenotev1_3_16"></a>Sokrates &#8212; the most persevering and
        acute Eristic of his age. </span></p>
    <p>Among these dissentients or negative dialecticians, Sokrates
      himself, during his life, stood prominent. In his footsteps
      followed Eukleides and the Megarics: who, though they acquired the
      unenviable surname of Eristics or Controversialists, cannot
      possibly have surpassed Sokrates, and probably did not equal him,
      in the refutative Elenchus. Of no one among the Megarics,
      probably, did critics ever affirm, what the admiring Xenophon says
      about Sokrates &#8212; &#8220;that he dealt with every one in colloquial
      debate just as he chose,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, that he baffled and
      puzzled his opponents whenever he chose. No one of these Megarics
      probably ever enunciated so sweeping a negative programme, or
      declared so emphatically his own inability to communicate positive
      instruction, as Sokrates in the Platonic Apology. A person more
      thoroughly Eristic than Sokrates never lived. And we see
      perfectly, from the Memorabilia of Xenophon (who nevertheless
      strives to bring out the opposite side of his character), that he
      was so esteemed among his contemporaries. Plato, as well as
      Eukleides, took up this vein in the Sokratic character, and worked
      it with unrivalled power in many of his dialogues. The Platonic
      Sokrates is compared, and compares himself, to Ant&aelig;us, who
      compelled every new-comer, willing or unwilling, to wrestle with
      him.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_29" href="#Footnotev1_3_29"><span

        negative character. </span></p>
    <p>Of the six dialogues composed by Eukleides, we cannot speak
      positively, because they are not preserved. But they cannot have
      been more refutative, and less affirmative, than most of the
      Platonic dialogues; and we can hardly be wrong in asserting that
      they were very inferior both in energy and attraction. The
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and the Parmenides, two of the most negative
      among the Platonic dialogues, seem to connect themselves, by the <i>personnel</i>
      of the drama, with the Megaric philosophers: the former dialogue
      is ushered in by Eukleides, and is, as it were, dedicated to him:
      the latter dialogue exhibits, as its <i>protagonistes</i>, the
      veteran Parmenides himself, who forms the one factor of the
      Megaric philosophy, while Sokrates forms the other. Parmenides (in
      the Platonic dialogue so called) is made to enforce the negative
      method in general terms, as a philosophical duty co-ordinate with
      the affirmative; and to illustrate it by a most elaborate
      argumentation, directed partly against the Platonic Ideas (here
      advocated by the youthful Sokrates), partly against his own (the
      Parmenidean) dogma of Ens Unum. Parmenides adduces unanswerable
      objections against the dogma of Transcendental Forms or Ideas; yet
      says at the same time that there can be no philosophy unless you
      admit it. He reproves the youthful Sokrates for precipitancy in
      affirming the dogma, and contends that you are not justified in
      affirming any dogma until you have gone through a bilateral
      scrutiny of it &#8212; that is, first assuming the doctrine to be true,
      next assuming it to be false, and following out the deductions
      arising from the one assumption as well as from the other.<a

      Parmenides then gives a string of successive <span

      (at great length, occupying the last half of the dialogue) &#8212; four
      pairs of counter-demonstrations or Antinomies &#8212; in which
      contradictory conclusions appear each to be alike proved. He
      enunciates the final result as follows:&#8212;&#8220;Whether Unum exists, or
      does not exist, Unum itself and C&aelig;tera, both exist and do
      not exist, both appear and do not appear, all things and in all

    <p>If this memorable dialogue, with its concluding string of
      elaborate antinomies, had come down to us under the name of
      Eukleides, historians would probably have denounced it as a
      perverse exhibition of ingenuity, worthy of &#8220;that litigious
      person, who first infused into the Megarians the fury of
      disputation&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_32" href="#Footnotev1_3_32"><span
          class="sp">32</span></a> But since it is of Platonic origin,
      we must recognise Plato not only as having divided with the
      Megaric philosophers the impulse of negative speculation which
      they had inherited from Sokrates, but as having carried that
      impulse to an extreme point of invention, combination, and
      dramatic handling, much beyond their powers. Undoubtedly, if we
      pass from the Parmenid&ecirc;s to other dialogues, we find Plato
      very different. He has various other intellectual impulses, an
      abundant flow of ideality and of constructive fancy, in many
      distinct channels. But negative philosophy is at least one of the
      indisputable and prominent items of the Platonic aggregate. </p>

        impulse with Sokrates and Plato. </span></p>
    <p>While then we admit that the Megaric succession of philosophers
      exhibited negative subtlety and vehement love of contentious
      debate, we must recollect that these qualities were inherited from
      Sokrates and shared with Plato. The philosophy of Sokrates, who
      taught nothing and cross-examined every one, was essentially more
      negative and controversial, both in him and his successors, than
      any which had preceded it. In an age when <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page127" id="v1page127"></a>127</span>dialectic
      colloquy was considered as appropriate for philosophical subjects,
      and when long continuous exposition was left to the rhetor &#8212;
      Eukleides established a succession or school<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_33" href="#Footnotev1_3_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
      which was more distinguished for impugning dogmas of others than
      for defending dogmas of its own. Schleiermacher and others suppose
      that Plato in his dialogue Euthyd&ecirc;mus intends to expose the
      sophistical fallacies of the Megaric school:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_34" href="#Footnotev1_3_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
      and that in the dialogue Sophist&ecirc;s, he refutes the same
      philosophers (under the vague designation of &#8220;the friends of
      Forms&#8221;) in their speculations about Ens and Non-Ens. The first of
      these two opinions is probably true to some extent, though we
      cannot tell how far: the second of the two is supported by some
      able critics &#8212; yet it appears to me untenable.<a

        If we may trust a sarcastic bon-mot ascribed to Diogenes the
        Cynic, the contemporary of the <i>viri Sokratici</i> and the
        follower of Antisthenes, the term &#963;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#8052; was applied to the

        Schleierm. Introduction to the Sophist&ecirc;s, pp. 134-135. </p>
      <p>See Deycks, Megaricorum Doctrina, p. 41 seq. Zeller, Phil. der
        Griech. vol. ii. p. 180 seq., with his instructive note. Prantl,
        Gesch. der Logik, vol. i. p. 37, and others cited by Zeller. &#8212;
        Ritter dissents from this view, and I concur in his dissent. To
        affirm that Eukleides admitted a plurality of Ideas or Forms, is
        to contradict the only one deposition, certain and unequivocal,
        which we have about his philosophy. His doctrine is that of the
        Transcendental Unum, Ens, Bonum; while the doctrine of the
        Transcendental Plura (Ideas or Forms) belongs to Plato and
        others. Both Deycks and Zeller (p. 185) recognise this as a
        difficulty. But to me it seems fatal to their hypothesis; which,
        after all, is only an hypothesis &#8212; first originated by
        Schleiermacher. If it be true that the Megarici are intended by
        Plato under the appellation &#959;&#7985; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8182;&#957; &#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;, we must suppose
        that the school had been completely transformed before the time
        of Stilpon, who is presented as the great opponent of &#964;&#8048; &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951;. </p></div>
      <p>Of Eukleides himself, though he is characterised as strongly
        controversial, no distinct points of controversy have been
        preserved: but his successor Eubulides is celebrated for various
        sophisms. He was the contemporary and rival of Aristotle: who,
        without however expressly naming him, probably intends to speak
        of him when alluding to the Megaric philosophers generally.<a
          name="FnAnchorv1_3_36" href="#Footnotev1_3_36"><span

        Aristokles, ap. Euseb. Pr&aelig;p. Ev. xv. 2. Eubulides is said
        not merely to have controverted the philosophical theories of
        Aristotle, but also to have attacked his personal character with
        bitterness and slander: a practice not less common in ancient
        controversy than in modern. About Alexinus, Diog. L. ii. 109. </p>
      <p>Among those who took lessons in rhetoric and pronunciation from
        Eubulides, we read the name of the orator Demosthenes, who is
        said to have improved his pronunciation thereby. Diog. Laert.

    <p>These sophisms are ascribed to Eubulides, and belonged probably
      to the Megaric school both before and after him. But it is plain
      both from the Euthyd&ecirc;mus of Plato, and from the Topica of
      Aristotle, that there were many others of similar character;
      frequently employed in the abundant dialectic colloquies which
      prevailed at Athens during the fourth and third centuries <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> Plato and Aristotle handle such
      questions and their authors contemptuously, under the name of
      Eristic: but it was more easy to put a bad name upon them, as well
      as upon the Eleate Zeno, than to elucidate the logical
      difficulties which they brought to view. Neither Aristotle nor
      Plato provided a sufficient answer to them: as is proved by the
      fact, that several subsequent philosophers wrote treatises
      expressly in reference to them &#8212; even philosophers of reputation,
      like Theophrastus and Chrysippus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_38"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> How these
      two latter philosophers performed their task, we cannot say. But
      the fact that they attempted the task, exhibits a commendable
      anxiety to make their logical theory complete, and to fortify it
      against objections. </p>

        sophisms, not calculated to deceive but to guard against
        deception. </span></p>
    <p>It is in this point of view &#8212; in reference to logical theory &#8212;
      that the Megaric philosophers have not been fairly appreciated.
      They, or persons reasoning in their manner, formed one essential
      encouragement and condition to the formation of any tolerable
      logical theory. They administered, to minds capable and
      constructive, that painful sense of contradiction, and shock of
      perplexity, which Sokrates relied upon as the stimulus to mental
      parturition &#8212; and which Plato extols as a lever for raising the
      student to general conceptions.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_39"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> Their
      sophisms were not intended to impose upon any one, but on the
      contrary, to guard against imposition.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_40"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> Whoever
      states a fallacy clearly and nakedly, applying it to a particular
      case in which it conducts to a conclusion known upon other
      evidence not to be true &#8212; contributes to divest it of its
      misleading effect. The persons most liable to be deceived by the
      fallacy are those who are not forewarned:&#8212;in cases where the
      premisses are stated not nakedly, but in an artful form of words &#8212;
      and where the conclusion, though false, is not known beforehand to
      be false by the hearer. To use Mr. John Stuart Mill&#8217;s phrase,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_41" href="#Footnotev1_3_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a>
      the fallacy is a case of apparent evidence mistaken for real
      evidence: you expose it to be evidence only apparent and not real,
      by giving a type of the fallacy, in which the conclusion obtained
      is <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page130" id="v1page130"></a>130</span>obviously



      false: and the more obviously false it is, the better suited for
      its tutelary purpose. Aristotle recognises, as indispensable in
      philosophical enquiry, the preliminary wrestling into which he
      conducts his reader, by means of a long string of unsolved
      difficulties or puzzles &#8212; (&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#953;). He declares distinctly and
      forcibly, that whoever attempts to lay out a positive theory,
      without having before his mind a full list of the difficulties
      with which he is to grapple, is like one who searches without
      knowing what he is looking for; without being competent to decide
      whether what he hits upon as a solution be really a solution or
      not.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_42" href="#Footnotev1_3_42"><span
          class="sp">42</span></a> Now that enumeration of puzzles which
      Aristotle here postulates (and in part undertakes, in reference to
      Philosophia Prima) is exactly what the Megarics, and various other
      dialecticians (called by Plato and Aristotle Sophists) contributed
      to furnish for the use of those who theorised on Logic. </p>

        The remarks of Ritter (Gesch. der Philos. ii. p. 189. 2nd ed.)
        upon these Megaric philosophers are more just and discerning
        than those made by most of the historians of philosophy &#8220;Doch
        darf man wohl annehmen, dass sie solche Trugschl&uuml;sse nicht
        zur <span class="correction" title="amended from
          'Ta&uuml;schung'">T&auml;uschung</span>, sondern zur Belehrung
        f&uuml;r unvorsichtige, oder zur Warnung vor der Seichtigkeit
        gew&ouml;hnlicher Vorstellungsweisen, gebrauchen wollten. So
        viel ist gewiss, dass die Megariker sich viel mit den Formen des
        Denken besch&auml;ftigten, vielleicht mehr zu Aufsuchung
        einzelner Regeln, als zur Begr&uuml;ndung eines
        wissenschaftlichen Zusammenhangs unter ihnen; obwohl auch
        besondere Theile der Logik unter ihren Schriften erw&auml;hnt

        Unversch&auml;mtheit des Doctrinarismus) belonging to these
        Megarici &#8220;the petulance and vanity which prompted them to seek
        celebrity by intentional offences against sound common sense,&#8221;
        &amp;c. (Gesch. der Logik, pp. 39-40. &#8212; Sir Wm. Hamilton has

    <p>Now the historians of philosophy seldom take this view of
      philosophy as a whole &#8212; as a field to which the free antithesis of
      affirmative and negative is indispensable. They consider true
      philosophy as represented by Sokrates, Plato, and Aristotle, one
      or other of them: while the contemporaries of these eminent men
      are discredited under the name of Sophists, Eristics, or
      sham-philosophers, sowing tares among the legitimate crop of wheat
      &#8212; or as devils whom the miraculous virtue of Sokrates and Plato is
      employed in expelling from the Athenian mind. Even the companions
      of Sokrates, and the Megarics among them, whom we know only upon
      the imperfect testimony of opponents, have fallen under this
      unmerited sentence:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_44"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> as if
      they were destructive agents breaking down an edifice of
      well-constituted philosophy &#8212; no such edifice in fact having ever
      existed in Greece, though there were several dissenting lecture
      rooms and conflicting veins of speculation promoted by eminent
      individuals. </p>

        The same charge is put by Cicero into the mouth of Lucullus
        against the Academics: &#8220;Similiter vos (Academici) quum
        perturbare, ut illi&#8221; (the Gracchi and others) &#8220;rempublicam, sic
        vos philosophiam, ben&egrave; jam constitutam velitis.&#8230; Tum
        exortus est, ut in optim&acirc; republic&acirc; Tib. Gracchus,
        qui otium perturbaret, sic Arcesilas, qui constitutam
        philosophiam everteret&#8221; (Acad. Prior, ii. 5, 14-15). </p>
      <p>Even in the liberal and comprehensive history of the Greek
        philosophy by Zeller (vol. ii. p. 187, ed. 2nd), respecting
        Eukleides&#8217; and the Megarians; &#8212; &#8220;Dagegen bot der <i>Streit
          gegen die geltenden Meinungen</i> dem Scharfsinn, der
        Rechthaberei, und dem wissenschaftlichen Ehrgeiz, ein
        unersch&ouml;pfliches Feld dar, welches denn auch die
        Megarischen Philosophen r&uuml;stig ausbeuteten.&#8221; </p>
      <p>If by &#8220;die geltenden Meinungen&#8221; Zeller means the common sense
        of the day that is, the opinions and beliefs current among the
        &#7984;&#948;&#953;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953;, the working, enjoying, non-theorising public &#8212; it is
        very true that the Megaric philosophers contended against them:
        but Sokrates and Plato contended against them quite as much: we
        see this in the Platonic Apology, Gorgias, Republic,
        Tim&aelig;us, Parmenid&ecirc;s, &amp;c. </p>
      <p>If, on the other hand, by &#8220;die geltenden Meinungen&#8221; Zeller
        means any philosophical or logical theories generally or
        universally admitted by thinking men as valid, the answer is
        that there were none such in the fourth and third centuries <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> Various eminent speculative
        individuals were labouring to construct such theories, each in
        his own way, and each with a certain congregation of partisans;
        but established theory there was none. Nor can any theory
        (whether accepted or not) be firm or trustworthy, unless it be
        exposed to the continued thrusts of the negative weapon,
        searching out its vulnerable points. We know of the Megarics
        only what they furnished towards that negative testing; without
        which, however, &#8212; as we may learn from Plato and Aristotle
        themselves, &#8212; the true value of the affirmative defences can
        never be measured.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Whoever undertakes, <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, to frame a complete
      and defensible logical theory, will desire to have before him a
      copious collection of such difficulties, and will consider those
      who propound <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page132"
          id="v1page132"></a>132</span>them as useful auxiliaries.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_45" href="#Footnotev1_3_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
      If he finds no one to propound them, he will have to imagine them
      for himself. &#8220;The philosophy of reasoning&#8221; (observes Mr. John
      Stuart Mill) &#8220;must comprise the philosophy of bad as well as of
      good reasoning.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_46" href="#Footnotev1_3_46"><span
          class="sp">46</span></a> The one cannot be complete without
      the other. To enumerate the different varieties of apparent
      evidence which is not real evidence (called Fallacies), and of
      apparent contradictions which are not real contradictions &#8212;
      referred as far as may be to classes, each illustrated by a
      suitable type &#8212; is among the duties of a logician. He will find
      this duty much facilitated, if there happen to exist around him an
      active habit of dialectic debate: ingenious men who really study
      the modes of puzzling and confuting a well-armed adversary, as
      well as of defending themselves against the like. Such a habit did
      exist at Athens: and unless it had existed, the Aristotelian
      theories on logic would probably never have been framed.
      Contemporary and antecedent dialecticians, the Megarici among
      them, supplied the stock of particular examples enumerated and
      criticised by Aristotle in the Topica:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_47"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> which
      treatise (especially the last book, De Sophisticis Elenchis) is
      intended both to explain the theory, and to give suggestions on
      the practice, of logical controversy. A man who takes lessons in
      fencing must learn not only how to thrust and parry, but also how
      to impose on his opponent by feints, and to meet the feints
      employed against himself: a general who learns the art of war must
      know how to take advantage of the enemy by effective cheating and
      treachery (to use the language of Xenophon), and how to avoid
      being cheated himself. The Aristotelian Topica, in <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page133" id="v1page133"></a>133</span>like



      manner, teach the arts both of dialectic attack and of dialectic
      defence.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_48" href="#Footnotev1_3_48"><span

        Marbach (Gesch. der Philos. s. 91), though he treats the
        Megarics as jesters (which I do not think they were), yet adds
        very justly: &#8220;Nevertheless these puzzles (propounded by the
        Megarics) have their serious and scientific side. We are forced
        to inquire, how it happens that the contradictions shown up in
        them are not merely possible but even necessary.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Both Tiedemann and Winckelmann also remark that the debaters
        called Eristics contributed greatly to the formation of the
        theory and precepts of Logic, afterwards laid out by Aristotle.
        Winckelmann, Prolegg. ad Platon. Euthydem. pp. xxiv.-xxxi. Even
        Stallbaum, though full of harshness towards those Sophists whom
        he describes as belonging to the school of Protagoras, treats
        the Megaric philosophers with much greater respect. Prolegom. ad

        Prantl (Gesch. der Logik, vol. i. pp. 43-50) ascribes to the
        Megarics all or nearly all the sophisms which Aristotle notices
        in the Treatise De Sophisticis Elenchis. This is more than can
        be proved, and more than I think probable. Several of them are
        taken from the Platonic Euthyd&ecirc;mus.</p>

        See the remarkable passages in the discourses of Sokrates
        (Memorab. iii. 1, 6; iv. 2, 15), and in that of Kambyses to
        Cyrus, which repeats the same opinion &#8212; Cyrop&aelig;d. i. 6, 27
        &#8212; respecting the amount of deceit, treachery, the thievish and
        rapacious qualities required for conducting war against an enemy
        &#8212; (&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#945;, i. 6, 34). </p>
      <p>Aristotle treats of Dialectic, as he does of Rhetoric, as an
        art having its theory, and precepts founded upon that theory. I
        shall have occasion to observe in a future chapter (<a
          href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#Sidenotev2_21_30">xxi</a>.), that logical
        Fallacies are not generated or invented by persons called
        Sophists, but are inherent liabilities to error in the human
        intellect; and that the habit of debate affords the only means
        of bringing them into clear daylight, and guarding against being
        deceived by them. Aristotle gives precepts both how to thrust,
        and how to parry with the best effect: if he had taught only how
        to parry, he would have left out one-half of the art. </p>
      <p>One of the most learned and candid of the Aristotelian
        commentators &#8212; M. Barth&eacute;lemy St. Hilaire &#8212; observes as
        follows (Logique d&#8217;Aristote, p. 435, Paris, 1838) respecting De
        Sophist. Elenchis:&#8212; </p>
      <p>&#8220;Aristote va donc s&#8217;occuper de la marche qu&#8217;il faut donner aux
        discussions sophistiques: et ici il serait difficile quelquefois
        de d&eacute;cider, &agrave; la mani&egrave;re dont les choses
        sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es par lui, si ce sont des conseils
        qu&#8217;il donne aux Sophistes, ou &agrave; ceux qui veulent
        &eacute;viter leurs ruses. Tout ce qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de,
        prouve, au reste, que c&#8217;est en ce dernier sens qu&#8217;il faut
        entendre la pens&eacute;e du philosophe. Ceci est d&#8217;ailleurs la
        seconde portion du tra&icirc;t&eacute;.&#8221; </p>
      <p>It appears to me that Aristotle intended to teach or to suggest
        both the two things which are here placed in Antithesis &#8212; though
        I do not agree with M. St. Hilaire&#8217;s way of putting the
        alternative &#8212; as if there were one class of persons,
        professional Sophists, who fenced with poisoned weapons, while
        every one except them refrained from such weapons. Aristotle
        intends to teach the art of Dialectic as a whole; he neither
        intends nor wishes that any learners shall make a bad use of his
        teaching; but if they do use it badly, the fault does not lie
        with him. See the observations in the beginning of the
        Rhetorica, i. p. 1355, a. 26, and the observations put by Plato
        into the mouth of Gorgias (Gorg. p. 456 E). </p>
      <p>Even in the Analytica Priora (ii. 19, a. 34) (independent of
        the Topica) Aristotle says:&#8212;&#967;&#961;&#8052; &#948;&#8217; &#8005;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;

      <p>I shall again have to touch on the Topica, in this point of
        view, as founded upon and illustrating the Megaric logical
        puzzles (<a href="#Sidenotev1_8_24">ch. viii.</a> of the present
        volume).</p>

        Mentiens. 2. The Veiled Man. 3. Sorites. 4. Cornutus. </span></p>
    <p>The Sophisms ascribed to Eubulid&ecirc;s, looked at from the
      point of view of logical theory, deserve that attention which they
      seem to have received. The logician lays down as a rule that no
      affirmative proposition can be at the same time true and false.
      Now the first sophism (called <i>Mentiens</i>) exhibits the case
      of a proposition which is, or appears to be, at the same time <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page134" id="v1page134"></a>134</span>true



      and false.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_49" href="#Footnotev1_3_49"><span
          class="sp">49</span></a> It is for the logician to explain how
      this proposition can be brought under his rule &#8212; or else to admit
      it as an exception. Again, the second sophism in the list (the
      Veiled or Hidden Man) is so contrived as to involve the respondent
      in a contradiction: he is made to say both that he knows his
      father, and that he does not know his father. Both the one answer
      and the other follow naturally from the questions and
      circumstances supposed. The contradiction points to the loose and
      equivocal way in which the word <i>to know</i> is used in common
      speech. Such equivocal meaning of words is not only one of the
      frequent sources of error and fallacy in reasoning, but also one
      of the least heeded by persons untrained in dialectics; who are
      apt to presume that the same word bears always the same meaning.
      To guard against this cause of error, and to determine (or impel
      others to determine) the accurate meaning or various distinct
      meanings of each word, is among the duties of the logician: and I
      will add that the verb <i>to know</i> stands high in the list of
      words requiring such determination &#8212; as the Platonic
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_50"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> alone
      would be sufficient to teach us. Farthermore, when we examine what
      is called the Sorit&ecirc;s of Eubulides, we perceive that it
      brings to view an inherent indeterminateness of various terms:
      indeterminateness which cannot be avoided, but which must be
      pointed out in order that it may not mislead. You cannot say how
      many grains are <i>much</i> &#8212; or how many grains <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page135" id="v1page135"></a>135</span>make



      <i>a heap</i>. When this want of precision, pervading many words
      in the language, was first brought to notice in a suitable special
      case, it would naturally appear a striking novelty. Lastly, the
      sophism called &#922;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#962; or Cornutus, is one of great
      plausibility, which would probably impose upon most persons, if
      the question were asked for the first time without any
      forewarning. It serves to administer a lesson, nowise unprofitable
      or superfluous, that before you answer a question, you should
      fully weigh its import and its collateral bearings. </p>

        Theophrastus wrote a treatise in three books on the solution of
        the puzzle called &#8009; &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; (see the list of his lost works
        in Diogenes L. v. 49). We find also other treatises entitled
        &#924;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#940; (which Diogenes cites, vi. 22), &#8212; &#7944;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962;

        several more titles relating to dialectics, and bearing upon the
        solution of syllogistic problems. Chrysippus also, in the
        ensuing century, wrote a treatise in three books, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
        &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; (Diog. vii. 107). Such facts show the
        importance of these problems in their bearing upon logical
        theory, as conceived by the ancient world. Epikurus also wrote
        against the &#924;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#943; (Diog. x. 27). </p>

        Various portions of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus illustrate this

    <p>The causes of error and fallacy are inherent in the complication
      of nature, the imperfection of language, the small range of facts

      The Megarics, far from being themselves deceivers, served as
      sentinels against deceit. They planted conspicuous beacons upon
      some of the sunken rocks whereon unwary reasoners were likely to
      be wrecked. When the general type of a fallacy is illustrated by a
      particular case in which the conclusion is manifestly untrue, the
      like fallacy is rendered less operative for the future. </p>

        Cicero, in his Academ. Prior, ii. 92-94, has very just remarks
        on the obscurities and difficulties in the reasoning process,

        Aristotle about Power. Arguments of Aristotle.</span> </p>
    <p>Of the positive doctrines of the Megarics we know little: but
      there is one upon which Aristotle enters into controversy with
      them, and upon which (as far as can be made out) I think they were
      in the right. In the question about Power, they held that the
      power to do a thing did not exist, except when the thing was <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page136" id="v1page136"></a>136</span>actually



      done: that an architect, for example, had no power to build a
      house, except when he actually did build one. Aristotle
      controverts this opinion at some length; contending that there
      exists a sort of power or cause which is in itself irregular and
      indeterminate, sometimes turning to the affirmative, sometimes to
      the negative, to do or not to do;<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_52"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> that the
      architect <i>has</i> the <i>power to build</i> constantly,
      though he exerts it only on occasion: and that many absurdities
      would follow if we did not admit, That a given power or energy &#8212;
      and the exercise of that power &#8212; are things distinct and

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_26"
          id="Sidenotev1_3_26"></a>These arguments not valid against the
        Megarici.</span> </p>
    <p>Now these arguments of Aristotle are by no means valid against
      the Megarics, whose doctrine, though apparently paradoxical, will
      appear when explained to be no paradox at all, but perfectly true.
      When we say that the architect has power to build, we do not mean
      that he has power to do so under all supposable circumstances, but
      only under certain conditions: we wish to distinguish him from
      non-professional men, who under those same conditions have no
      power to build. The architect must be awake and sober: he must
      have the will or disposition to build:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_54"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> he must
      be provided with tools and materials, and be secure against
      destroying enemies. These and other conditions being generally
      understood, it is unnecessary to enunciate them in common speech.
      But when we engage in dialectic analysis, the accurate discussion
      (&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;) indispensable to philosophy requires us to bring
      under distinct notice, that which the elliptical character of
      common speech implies without enunciating. Unless these favourable
      conditions be supposed, the architect is no more able to build
      than an ordinary non-professional man. Now the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page137" id="v1page137"></a>137</span>Megarics



      did not deny the distinctive character of the architect, as
      compared with the non-architect: but they defined more accurately
      in what it consisted, by restoring the omitted conditions. They
      went a step farther: they pointed out that whenever the architect
      finds himself in concert with these accompanying conditions (his
      own volition being one of the conditions) he goes to work &#8212; and
      the building is produced. As the house is not built, unless he
      wills to build, and has tools and materials, &amp;c. &#8212; so
      conversely, whenever he has the will to build and has tools and
      materials, &amp;c., the house is actually built. The effect is not
      produced, except when the full assemblage of antecedent conditions
      come together: but as soon as they do come together, the effect is
      assuredly produced. The accomplishments of the architect, though
      an essential item, are yet only one item among several, of the
      conditions necessary to building the house. He has no power to
      build, except when those other conditions are assumed along with
      him: in other words, he has no such power except when he actually
      does build. </p>

    <p>Aristotle urges against the Megarics various arguments, as
      follows:&#8212;1. Their doctrine implies that the architect is not an
      architect, and does not possess his professional skill,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_55" href="#Footnotev1_3_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>
      except at the moment when he is actually building. &#8212; But the
      Megarics would have denied that their doctrine did imply this. The
      architect possesses his art at all times: but his art does not
      constitute a power of building except under certain accompanying
      conditions. </p>

    </div>
    <p>2. The Megaric doctrine is the same as that of Protagoras,
      implying that there exists no perceivable Object, and no Subject
      capable of perceiving, except at the moment when perception
      actually takes place.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_56"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> On this
      we may observe, that the Megarics coincide with Protagoras thus
      far, that they bring into open daylight the relative and
      conditional, which the received phraseology tends to hide. But
      neither they nor he affirm what is here put upon them. When we
      speak of a perceivable Object, we mean that which may and will be
      perceived, <i>if</i> there be a proper Subject to perceive it:
      when we affirm a Subject capable of perception, we mean, one which
      will perceive, under those <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page138" id="v1page138"></a>138</span>circumstances
      which we call the presence of an Object suitably placed. The
      Subject and Object are correlates: but it is convenient to have a
      language in which one of them alone is introduced unconditionally,
      while the conditional sign is applied to the correlate: though the
      matter affirmed involves a condition common to both. </p>

    </div>
    <p>3. According to the Megaric doctrine (Aristotle argues) every man
      when not actually seeing, is blind; every man when not actually
      speaking, is dumb. &#8212; Here the Megarics would have said that this
      is a misinterpretation of the terms dumb and blind; which denote a
      person who cannot speak or see, even though he wishes it. One who
      is now silent, though not dumb, may speak if he wills it: but his
      own volition is an essential condition.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_57"

        The question between Aristotle and the Megarics has not passed
        out of debate with modern philosophers. </p>
      <p>Dr. Thomas Brown observes, in his inquiry into Cause and Effect
        &#8212; &#8220;From the mere silence of any one, we cannot infer that he is
        dumb in consequence of organic imperfection. He may be silent
        only because he has no desire of speaking, not because speech
        would not have followed his desire: and it is not with the mere
        <i>existence</i> of any one, but <i>with his desire of speaking</i>,
        that we suppose utterance to be connected. A man who has <i>no
          desire of speaking, has in truth</i>, and in strictness of
        language, <i>no power of speaking, when in that state of mind</i>:
        since he has not a circumstance which, as immediately prior, is
        essential to speech. But since he has that power, as soon as the
        new circumstance of desire arises &#8212; and as the presence or
        absence of the desire cannot be perceived but in its effects &#8212; <i>there



          is no inconvenience in the common language</i>, which ascribes
        the power, <i>as if it were possessed at all times, and in all
          circumstances of mind</i>, though unquestionably, nothing more
        is meant than that the desire existing will be followed by
        utterance.&#8221; (Brown, Essay on the Relation of Cause and Effect,
        p. 200.) </p>
      <p>This is the real sense of what Aristotle calls &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; (&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;)
        &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957;, &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#946;&#945;&#948;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#946;&#945;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#949;&#957; &#7938;&#957;, <i>i.e.</i>
        he will walk <i>if</i> he desires to do so (De Interpret. p.
        23, a. 9-15).</p>
    </div>
    <p>4. According to the Megaric doctrine (says Aristotle) when you
      are now lying down, you have no power to rise: when you are
      standing up, you have no power to lie down: so that the present
      condition of affairs must continue for ever unchanged: nothing can
      come into existence which is not now in being. &#8212; Here again, the
      Megarics would have denied his inference. The man who is now
      standing up, has power to lie down, <i>if he wills</i> to do so &#8212;
      or he may be thrown down by a superior force: that is, he will lie
      down, <i>if</i> some new fact of a certain character shall
      supervene. The Megarics do not deny that he has power, <i>if</i>
      &#8212; so and so: they deny that he has power, without the <i>if</i> &#8212;
      that is, without the farther accompaniments essential to energy. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_3_28"></a>Potential as distinguished from the
        Actual &#8212; What it is. </span></p>
    <p>On the whole, it seems to me that Aristotle&#8217;s refutation of the
      Megarics is unsuccessful. A given assemblage of conditions is
      requisite for the production of any act: while there are other
      circumstances, which, if present at the same time, would defeat
      its production. We often find it convenient to describe a state of
      things in which some of the antecedent conditions are present
      without the rest: in which therefore the act is not produced, yet
      would be produced, if the remaining circumstances were present,
      and if the opposing circumstances were absent.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_58" href="#Footnotev1_3_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
      The state of things thus described is the <i>potential</i> as
      distinguished from the <i>actual</i>: power, distinguished from
      act or energy: it represents an incomplete assemblage of the
      antecedent positive conditions &#8212; or perhaps a complete assemblage,
      but counteracted by some opposing circumstances. As soon as the
      assemblage becomes complete, and the opposing circumstances
      removed, the potential passes into the actual. The architect, when
      he is not building, possesses, not indeed the full or plenary
      power to build, but an important fraction of that power, which
      will become plenary when the other fractions supervene, but will
      then at the same time become operative, so as to produce the
      actual building.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_59" href="#Footnotev1_3_59"><span

        Hobbes, in his Computation or Logic (chaps. ix. and x. Of Cause
        and Effect. Of Power and Act) expounds this subject with his
        usual perspicuity. </p>
      <p>&#8220;A Cause simply, or an Entire Cause, is the aggregate of all
        the accidents, both of the agents, how many soever they be, and
        of the patient, put together; which, when they are all supposed
        to be present, it cannot be understood but that the effect is
        produced at the same instant: and if any one of them be wanting,
        it cannot be understood but that the effect is not produced&#8221;
        (ix. 3). </p>
      <p>&#8220;Correspondent to Cause and Effect are Power and Act: nay,
        those and these are the same things, though for divers
        considerations they have divers names. For whensoever any agent
        has all those accidents which are necessarily requisite for the
        production of some effect in the patient, then we say that agent
        has power to produce that effect if it be applied to a patient.
        In like manner, whensoever any patient has all those accidents
        which it is requisite it should have for the production of some
        effect in it, we say it is in the power of that patient to
        produce that effect if it be applied to a fitting agent. Power,
        active and passive, are parts only of plenary and entire power:
        nor, except they be joined, can any effect proceed from them.
        And therefore these powers are but conditional: namely, the
        agent has power if it be applied to a patient, and the patient
        has power if it be applied to an agent. <i>Otherwise neither of
          them have power, nor can the accidents which are in them
          severally be properly called powers</i>: nor any action be
        said to be possible for the power of the agent alone or the
        patient alone.&#8221;</p>

        Aristotle does in fact grant all that is here said, in the same
        book and in the page next subsequent to that which contains his
        arguments against the Megaric doctrine, Metaphys. &#920;. 5, 1048, a.
        1-24. </p>
      <p>In this chapter Aristotle distinguishes powers belonging to
        things, from powers belonging to persons &#8212; powers irrational
        from powers rational &#8212; powers in which the agent acts without
        any will or choice, from those in which the will or choice of
        the agent is one item of the aggregate of conditions. He here
        expressly recognises that the power of the agent, separately
        considered, is only <i>conditional</i>; that is, conditional on
        the presence and suitable state of the patient, as well as upon
        the absence of counteracting circumstances. But he contends that
        such absence of counteracting circumstances is plainly implied,
        and need not be expressly mentioned in the definition. </p>

        &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7956;&#957;&#953;&#945;. The commentary of Alexander Aphr. upon this
        chapter is well worth consulting (pp. 546-548 of the edition of
        his commentary by Bonitz, 1847). Moreover Aristotle affirms in
        this chapter, that when &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; come
        together under suitable circumstances, the power will certainly
        pass into act. </p>
      <p>Here then, it seems to me, Aristotle concedes the doctrine
        which the Megarics affirmed; or, if there be any difference
        between them, it is rather verbal than real. In fact,
        Aristotle&#8217;s reasoning in the third chapter (wherein he impugns
        the doctrine of the Megarics), and the definition of &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8056;&#957;
        which he gives in that chapter (1047, a. 25), are hardly to be
        reconciled with his reasoning in the fifth chapter. Bonitz
        (Notes on the Metaphys. pp. 393-395) complains of the <i>mira
          levitas</i> of Aristotle in his reasoning against the
        Megarics, and of his omitting to distinguish between <i>Verm&ouml;gen</i>
        and <i>M&ouml;glichkeit</i>. I will not use so uncourteous a
        phrase; but I think his refutation of the Megarics is both
        unsatisfactory and contradicted by himself. I agree with the
        following remark of Bonitz:&#8212;&#8220;Nec mirum, quod Megarici, aliis
        illi quidem in rebus arguti, in h&acirc;c autem satis acuti,
        existentiam &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#953; tribuere recusarint,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

        about &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957;. </span></p>
    <p>The doctrine which I have just been canvassing is expressly cited
      by Aristotle as a Megaric doctrine, and was therefore probably
      held by his contemporary Eubulid&ecirc;s. From the pains which
      Aristotle takes (in the &#8216;De Interpretatione&#8217; and elsewhere) to
      explain and vindicate his own doctrine about the Potential and the
      Actual, we may see that it was a theme much debated among the
      dialecticians of the day. And we read of another Megaric, Diodorus<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_60" href="#Footnotev1_3_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a>
      Kronus, perhaps contemporary (yet probably a little later than
      Aristotle), as advancing a position substantially the same as that
      of Eubulid&ecirc;s. That alone is possible (Diodorus affirmed)
      which either is happening now, or will happen at some future time.
      As in speaking about facts of an unrecorded past, we know well
      that a given fact either occurred or did not occur, yet without
      knowing which of the two is true &#8212; and therefore we affirm only
      that the fact <i>may</i> have occurred: so also about the future,
      either the assertion that a given fact will at some time <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page141" id="v1page141"></a>141</span>occur,



      is positively true, or the assertion that it will never occur, is
      positively true: the assertion that it may or may not occur some
      time or other, represents only our ignorance, which of the two is
      true. That which will never at any time occur, is impossible. </p>

        The dialectic ingenuity of Diodorus is powerfully attested by
        the verse of Ariston, applied to describe Arkesilaus (Sextus

    <p>The argument here recited must have been older than Diodorus,
      since Aristotle states and controverts it: but it seems to have
      been handled by him in a peculiar dialectic arrangement, which
      obtained the title of &#8009; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#973;&#969;&#957;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_61"

      Stoics (especially Chrysippus), in times somewhat later, impugned
      the opinion of Diodorus, though seemingly upon grounds not quite
      the same as Aristotle. This problem was one upon which speculative
      minds occupied themselves for several centuries. Aristotle and
      Chrysippus maintained that affirmations respecting the past were <i>necessary</i>
      (one necessarily true and the other necessarily false) &#8212;
      affirmations respecting the future, <i>contingent</i> (one must
      be true and the other false, but either might be true). Diodorus
      held that both varieties of affirmations were equally necessary &#8212;
      Kleanthes the Stoic thought that both were equally contingent.<a

    <p>It was thus that the Megaric dialecticians, with that fertility

      stirred up many real problems and difficulties connected with
      logical evidence, and supplied matters for discussion which not
      only occupied the speculative minds of the next four or five

      conditions regularly antecedent, and assemblages of events <span

      consequent; though from the number and complication of causes,
      partly co-operating and partly conflicting with each other, we
      with our limited intelligence are often unable to predict the
      course of events in each particular situation. Sokrates, Plato,
      and Aristotle, all maintained that regular sequence of antecedent
      and consequent was not universal, but partial only:<a

      that there were some agencies essentially regular, in which
      observation of the past afforded ground for predicting the future
      &#8212; other agencies (or the same agencies on different occasions)
      essentially irregular, in which the observation of the past
      afforded no such ground. Aristotle admitted a graduation of causes
      from perfect regularity to perfect irregularity:&#8212;1. The Celestial
      Spheres, with their included bodies or divine persons, which
      revolved and exercised a great and preponderant influence
      throughout the Kosmos, with perfect uniformity; having no power of
      contraries, <i>i.e.</i>, having no power of doing anything else
      but what they actually did (having &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#945; without &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;). 2.
      The four Elements, in which the natural agencies were to a great
      degree necessary and uniform, but also in a certain degree
      otherwise &#8212; either always or for the most part uniform (&#964;&#8056; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054;
      &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;) &#8212; tending by inherent appetency towards uniformity, but
      not always attaining it. 3. Besides these there were two other
      varieties of Causes accidental, or perfectly irregular &#8212; Chance
      and Spontaneity: powers of contraries, or with equal chance of
      contrary manifestations &#8212; essentially capricious, undeterminable,
      unpredictable.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_64" href="#Footnotev1_3_64"><span
          class="sp">64</span></a> This <i>Chance</i> of Aristotle &#8212;
      with one of two contraries sure to turn up, though you could never
      tell beforehand which of the two &#8212; was a conception analogous to
      what logicians sometimes call an Indefinite Proposition, or to
      what some grammarians have reckoned as a special variety of
      genders called the <i>doubtful gender</i>. There were thus
      positive causes of regularity, and positive <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page143" id="v1page143"></a>143</span>causes of
      irregularity, the co-operation or conflict of which gave the total
      manifestations of the actual universe. The principle of
      irregularity, or the Indeterminate, is sometimes described under
      the name of Matter,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_65"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> as
      distinguishable from, yet co-operating with, the three determinate
      Causes &#8212; Formal, Efficient, Final. The Potential &#8212; the
      Indeterminate &#8212; the <i>May or May not be</i> &#8212; is characterised
      by Aristotle as one of the inherent principles operative in the
      Kosmos. </p>

      <p>Matter is represented as the principle of irregularity, of &#964;&#8056;
        &#8001;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8217; &#7956;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#949; &#8212; as the &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#969;&#957;. </p>
      <p>In the explanation given by Alexander of Aphrodisias of the
        Peripatetic doctrine respecting chance &#8212; free-will, the
        principle of irregularity &#8212; &#964;&#973;&#967;&#951; is no longer assigned to the
        material cause, but is treated as an &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#943;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;,
        distinguished from &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#943;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; or &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#940;. The
        exposition given of the doctrine by Alexander is valuable and
        interesting. See his treatise De Fato, addressed to the Emperor
        Severus, in the edition of Orelli, Zurich. 1824 (a very useful
        volume, containing treatises of Ammonius, Plotinus, Bardesanes,
        &amp;c., on the same subject); also several sections of his
        Qu&aelig;stiones Naturales et Morales, ed. Spengel, Munich,
        1842, pp. 22-61-65-123, &amp;c. He gives, however, a different
        explanation of &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8056;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957; in pp. 62-63, which
        would not be at variance with the doctrine of Diodorus. We may
        remark that Alexander puts the antithesis of the two doctrines
        differently from Aristotle, &#8212; in this way. 1. Either all events
        happen &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957;. 2. Or all events do not happen &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217;
        &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957;, but some events are &#7952;&#966;&#8217; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;. See De Fato, p. 14
        seq. This way of putting the question is directed more against
        the Stoics, who were the great advocates of &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;, than
        against the Megaric Diodorus. The treatises of Chrysippus and
        the other Stoics alter both the wording and the putting of the
        thesis. We know that Chrysippus impugned the doctrine of
        Diodorus, but I do not see how. </p>
      <p>The Stoic antithesis of &#964;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#8212; &#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#966;&#8217; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; is
        different from the antithesis conceived by Aristotle and does
        not touch the question about the universality of regular
        sequence. &#932;&#8048; &#7952;&#966;&#8217; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; describes those sequences in which human
        volition forms one among the appreciable conditions determining
        or modifying the result; &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957; includes all the
        other sequences wherein human volition has no appreciable
        influence. But the sequence &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#966;&#8217; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; is just as regular as
        the sequence &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957;: both the one and the other are
        often imperfectly predictable, because our knowledge of facts
        and power of comparison is so imperfect. </p>
      <p>Theophrastus discussed &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957;, and explained it to
        mean the same as &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957;. &#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#948;&#8050; &#920;&#949;&#972;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;

    <p>In what manner Diodorus stated and defended his opinion upon this
      point, we have no information. We know only that he placed
      affirmations respecting the future on the same footing as
      affirmations respecting the past: maintaining that our potential
      affirmation &#8212; <i>May or May not be</i> &#8212; respecting some future
      event, meant no more than it means respecting some past event,
      viz.: no inherent indeterminateness in the future sequence, but
      our <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page144" id="v1page144"></a>144</span>ignorance



      of the determining conditions, and our inability to calculate
      their combined working.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_66"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> In regard
      to scientific method generally, this problem is of the highest
      importance: for it is only so far as uniformity of sequence
      prevails, that facts become fit matter for scientific study.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_67" href="#Footnotev1_3_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a>
      Consistently with the doctrine of all-pervading uniformity of
      sequence, the definition of Hobbes gives the only complete account
      of the Impossible and Possible: <i>i.e.</i> an account such as
      would appear to an omniscient calculator, where <i>May or May not</i>
      merge in <i>Will or Will not</i>. According as each person falls
      short of or approaches this ideal <span class="pagenum"><a

      according to his knowledge and mental resource, inductive and
      deductive &#8212; will be his appreciation of what may be or may not be
      &#8212; as of what may have been or may not have been during the past.
      But such appreciation, being relative to each individual mind, is
      liable to vary indefinitely, and does not admit of being embodied
      in one general definition. </p>

      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_3_66"
            id="Footnotev1_3_66"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv1_3_66">66</a></span>
        The same doctrine as that of the Megaric Diodorus is declared by
        Hobbes in clear and explicit language (First Grounds of
        Philosophy, ii. 10, 4-5):&#8212;&#8220;That is an impossible act, for the
        production of which there is no power plenary. For seeing
        plenary power is that in which all things concur which are
        requisite for the production of an <span class="correction"
          title="amended from 'art'">act</span>, if the power shall
        never be plenary, there will always be wanting some of those
        things, without which the act cannot be produced. Wherefore that
        act shall never be produced: that is, that act is <i>impossible</i>.
        And every act, which is not impossible, is <i>possible</i>.
        Every act therefore which is possible, shall at some time or
        other be produced. For if it shall never be produced, then those
        things shall never concur which are requisite for the production
        of it; wherefore the act is <i>impossible</i>, by the
        definition; which is contrary to what was supposed. </p>
      <p>&#8220;A <i>necessary act</i> is that, the production of which it is
        impossible to hinder: and therefore every act that shall be
        produced, shall necessarily be produced; for that it shall not
        be produced is impossible, because, as has already been
        demonstrated, every possible act shall at some time be produced.
        Nay, this proposition &#8212; <i>What shall be shall be</i> &#8212; is as
        necessary a proposition as this &#8212; <i>A man is a man</i>. </p>
      <p>&#8220;But here, perhaps, some man will ask whether those future
        things which are commonly called <i>contingents</i>, are
        necessary. I say, then, that generally all contingents have
        their necessary causes, but are called <i>contingents</i>, in
        respect of other events on which they do not depend &#8212; as the
        rain which shall be to-morrow shall be necessary, that is, from
        necessary causes; but we think and say, it happens by chance,
        because we do not yet perceive the causes thereof, though they
        exist now. For men commonly call that <i>casual</i> or <i>contingent</i>,
        whereof they do not perceive the necessary cause: <i>and in the
          same manner they use to speak of things past, when not knowing
          whether a thing be done or not, they say, It is possible it
          never was done.</i> </p>
      <p>&#8220;Wherefore all propositions concerning future things,
        contingent or not contingent, as this &#8212; It will rain to-morrow,
        or To-morrow the sun will rise &#8212; are either necessarily true or
        necessarily false: but we call them contingent, because we do
        not yet know whether they be true or false; whereas their verity
        depends not upon our knowledge, but upon the foregoing of their
        causes. But there are some, who, though they will confess this
        whole proposition &#8212; <i> To-morrow it will either rain or not
          rain</i> &#8212; to be true, yet they will not acknowledge the parts
        of it, as, <i>To-morrow it will rain</i>, or <i>To-morrow it
          will not rain</i>, to be either of them true by itself;
        because (they say) neither this nor that is true <i>determinately</i>.
        But what is this <i>true determinately</i>, but true <i>upon
          our knowledge</i> or <i>evidently true</i>? And therefore
        they say no more but that it is not yet known whether it be true
        or not; but they say it more obscurely, and darken the evidence
        of the truth with the same words by which they endeavour to hide
        their own ignorance.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Besides the above doctrine respecting Possible and Impossible,

        hypothetical proposition was true, if both the antecedent and
        consequent were true &#8212; &#8220;If it be day, I am conversing&#8221;. Diodorus
        denied that this proposition, as an Hypothetical proposition,
        was true: since the consequent might be false, though the
        antecedent were true. An Hypothetical proposition was true only
        when, assuming the antecedent to be true, the consequent must be
        true also.</p>

    <p>But if he reproduced the arguments of Zeno, he also employed
      another, peculiar to himself. He admitted the reality of <i>past</i>
      motion: but he denied the reality of <i>present</i> motion. You
      may affirm truly (he said) that a thing <i>has been moved</i>:
      but you cannot truly affirm that any thing <i>is being moved</i>.
      Since it was <i>here</i> before, and is <i>there</i> now, you
      may be sure that it has been moved: but actual present motion you
      cannot perceive or prove. Affirmation in the perfect tense may be
      true, when affirmation in the present tense neither is nor ever
      was true: thus it is true to say &#8212; Helen <i>had</i> three
      husbands (Menelaus, Paris, Deiphobus): but it was never true to
      say &#8212; Helen <i>has</i> three husbands, since they became her
      husbands in succession.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_69"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> Diodorus
      supported this paradox by some ingenious arguments, and the
      opinion which he denied seems to have presented itself to him as
      involving the position of indivisible minima &#8212; atoms of body,
      points of space, instants of time. He admitted such minima of
      atoms, but not of space or time: and without such admission he
      could not make intelligible to himself the fact of present or
      actual motion. He could find no present <i>Now</i> or Minimum of
      Time; without which <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page146"

      to have found this inexplicable moment of transition, but he
      describes it in terms not likely to satisfy a dialectical mind:
      and Aristotle denying that the Now is any portion or constituent
      part of time, considers it only as a boundary of the past and
      future.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_71" href="#Footnotev1_3_71"><span

        To illustrate this apparent paradox of Diodorus, affirming past
        motion, but denying present motion, we may compare what is said
        by Aristotle about the Now or Point of Present Time &#8212; that it is
        not a part, but a boundary between Past and Future. </p>

      <p>Which doctrine is thus rendered by Harris in his Hermes, ch.
        vii. pp. 101-103-105:&#8212;&#8220;Both Points and Nows being taken as
        Bounds, and not as Parts, it will follow that in the same manner
        as the same point may be the end of one line and the beginning
        of another &#8212; so the same Now may be the End of one time, and the
        beginning of another.&#8230; I say of these two times, that with
        respect to the <i>Now</i>, or Instant which they include, the
        first of them is necessarily Past time, as being previous to it:
        the other is necessarily Future, as being subsequent.&#8230; From the
        above speculations, there follow some conclusions, which may be
        called paradoxes, till they have been attentively considered. In
        the first place, there cannot (strictly speaking) be any such
        thing as Time Present. For if all Time be transient, as well as
        continuous, it cannot like a line be present altogether, but
        part will necessarily be gone and part be coming. If therefore
        any portion of its continuity were to be present at once, it
        would so far quit its transient nature, and be Time no longer.
        But if no portion of its continuity can be thus present, how can
        Time possibly be present, to which such continuity is
        essential?&#8221; &#8212; Compare Sir William Hamilton&#8217;s Discussions on
        Philosophy, p. 581.</p>

        future. </span></p>
    <p>This opinion of Aristotle is in the main consonant with that of
      Diodorus; who, when he denied the reality of present motion, meant
      probably only to deny the reality of <i>present motion apart from
        past and future motion</i>. Herein also we find him agreeing
      with Hobbes, who denies the same in clearer language.<a

      Sextus Empiricus declares <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page147" id="v1page147"></a>147</span>Diodorus to have
      been inconsistent in admitting past motion while he denied present
      motion.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_73" href="#Footnotev1_3_73"><span
          class="sp">73</span></a> But this seems not more inconsistent
      than the doctrine of Aristotle respecting the <i>Now</i> of time.
      I know, when I compare a child or a young tree with what they
      respectively were a year ago, that they have grown: but whether
      they actually are growing, at every moment of the intervening
      time, is not ascertainable by sense, and is a matter of probable
      inference only.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_74" href="#Footnotev1_3_74"><span
          class="sp">74</span></a> Diodorus could not understand present
      motion, except in conjunction with past and future motion, as
      being the common limit of the two: but he could understand past
      motion, without reference to present or future. He could not state
      to himself a satisfactory theory respecting the beginning of
      motion: as we may see by his reasonings distinguishing the motion
      of a body all at once in its integrity, from the motion of a body
      considered as proceeding from the separate motion of its
      constituent atoms &#8212; the moving atoms preponderating over the atoms
      at rest, and determining them to motion,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_75"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> until
      gradually the whole body came to move. The same argument
      re-appears in another example, when he argues &#8212; The wall does not
      fall while its component stones hold together, for then it is
      still standing: nor yet when they have come apart, for then it <i>has</i>
      fallen.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_76" href="#Footnotev1_3_76"><span

        Hobbes, First Grounds of Philosophy, ii. 8, 11. &#8220;That is said to
        be at rest which, during any time, is in one place; and that to
        be moved, or to have been moved, which whether it be now at rest
        or moved, was formerly in another place from that which it is
        now in. From which definition it may be inferred, first, that
        whatsoever is moved <i>has been</i> moved: for if it still be
        in the same place in which it was formerly, it is at rest: but
        if it be in another place, it <i>has been</i> moved, by the
        definition of moved. Secondly, that what <i>is</i> moved, <i>will



          yet</i> be moved: for that which is moved, leaveth the place
        where it is, and consequently will be moved still. Thirdly, that
        whatsoever is moved, is not in one place during any time, how
        little soever that may be: for by the definition of rest, that
        which is in one place during any time, is at rest. &#8230; From what
        is above demonstrated &#8212; namely, that whatsoever <i>is</i>
        moved, <i>has also been</i> moved, and <i>will be</i> moved:
        this also may be collected, That there can be no conception of
        motion without conceiving past and future time.&#8221;</p>

    <p>That Diodorus was a person seriously anxious to solve logical

      date can hardly be settled), was equal, if not superior, to that
      of any contemporary philosopher. He was visited by listeners from
      all parts of Greece, and he drew away pupils from the most
      renowned teachers of the day; from Theophrastus as well as the
      others.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_78" href="#Footnotev1_3_78"><span

    <p>Contemporary with Stilpon (or perhaps somewhat later) was
      Mened&ecirc;mus of Eretria, whose philosophic parentage is traced
      to Ph&aelig;don. The name of Ph&aelig;don has been immortalised,
      not by his own works, but by the splendid dialogue of which Plato
      has made him the reciter. He is said (though I doubt the fact) to
      have been a native of Elis. He was of good parentage, a youthful
      companion of Sokrates in the last years of his life.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_81" href="#Footnotev1_3_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
      After the death of Sokrates, Ph&aelig;don went to Elis, composed
      some dialogues, and established a succession <span

      sect of philosophers &#8212; Pleistanus, Anchipylus, Moschus. Of this

      contemporary and hearer of Stilpon, became the most eminent
      representative, and from him it was denominated Eretriac instead
      of Eleian. The Eretriacs, as well as the Megarics, took up the
      negative arm of philosophy, and were eminent as puzzlers and
      controversialists. </p>

        The story given by Diogenes L. (ii. 31 and 106; compare Aulus
        Gellius, ii. 18) about Ph&aelig;don&#8217;s adventures antecedent to
        his friendship with Sokrates, is unintelligible to me.
        &#8220;Ph&aelig;don was made captive along with his country (Elis),
        sold at Athens, and employed in a degrading capacity; until
        Sokrates induced Alkibiades or Kriton to pay his ransom.&#8221; Now,
        no such event as the capture of Elis, and the sale of its
        Eupatrids as slaves, happened at that time: the war between
        Sparta and Elis (described by Xenophon, Hell. iii. 2, 21 seq.)
        led to no such result, and was finished, moreover, after the
        death of Sokrates. Alkibiades had been long in exile. If, in the
        text of Diogenes, where we now read &#934;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#969;&#957;, <span class="gesp">&#7981;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>,

        would be rendered consistent with known historical facts. The
        Athenians captured the island of Melos in 415 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>, put to death the Melians of
        military age, and sold into slavery the younger males as well as
        the females (Thucyd. v. 116). If Ph&aelig;don had been a Melian
        youth of good family, he would have been sold at Athens, and
        might have undergone the adventures narrated by Diogenes. We
        know that Alkibiades purchased a female Melian as slave
        (Pseudo-Andokides cont. Alkibiad.).</p>

        Diog. L. ii. 105, 126 seq. There was a statue of Mened&ecirc;mus
        in the ancient stadium of Eretria: Diogenes speaks as if it
        existed in his time, and as if he himself had seen it (ii. 132).</p>

    <p>But though this was the common character of the two, in a logical

      elements became blended with the logical. These persons combined,
      in part at least, the free censorial speech of Antisthenes with
      the subtlety of Eukleides. What we hear of Mened&ecirc;mus is
      chiefly his bitter, stinging sarcasms, and clever repartees. He
      did not, like the Cynic Diogenes, live in contented poverty, but
      occupied a prominent place (seemingly under the patronage of
      Antigonus and Demetrius) in the government of his native city
      Eretria. Nevertheless he is hardly less celebrated than Diogenes
      for open speaking of his mind, and carelessness of giving offence
      to others.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_83" href="#Footnotev1_3_83"><span

    <p>Antisthenes, the originator of the Cynic succession of
      philosophers, was one of those who took up principally the ethical
      element of the Sokratic discoursing, which the Megarics left out
      or passed lightly over. He did not indeed altogether leave out the
      logical element: all his doctrines respecting it, as far as we
      hear of them, appear to have been on the negative side. But <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page150" id="v1page150"></a>150</span>respecting



      ethics, he laid down affirmative propositions,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_84" href="#Footnotev1_3_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a>
      and delivered peremptory precepts. His aversion to pleasure, by
      which he chiefly meant sexual pleasure, was declared in the most
      emphatic language. He had therefore, in the negative logic, a
      point of community with Eukleides and the Megarics: so that the
      coalescence of the two successions, in Stilpon and
      Mened&ecirc;mus, is a fact not difficult to explain. </p>

    <p>The life of Sokrates being passed in conversing with a great
      variety of persons and characters, his discourses were of course
      multifarious, and his ethical influence operated in different
      ways. His mode of life, too, exercised a certain influence of its
      own. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_39"

        Sokrates, in plainness and rigour. </span></p>
    <p>Antisthenes, and his disciple Diogenes, were in many respects
      closer approximations to Sokrates than either Plato or any other
      of the Sokratic companions. The extraordinary colloquial and
      cross-examining force was indeed a peculiar gift, which Sokrates
      bequeathed to none of them: but Antisthenes took up the Sokratic
      purpose of inculcating practical ethics not merely by word of
      mouth, but also by manner of life. He was not inferior to his
      master in contentment under poverty, in strength of will and
      endurance,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_85" href="#Footnotev1_3_85"><span
          class="sp">85</span></a> in acquired insensibility both to
      pain and pleasure, in disregard of opinion around him, and in
      fearless exercise of a self-imposed censorial mission. He learnt
      from Sokrates indifference to conventional restraints and social
      superiority, together with the duty of reducing wants to a
      minimum, and stifling all such as were above the lowest term of
      necessity. To this last point, Sokrates gave a religious colour,
      proclaiming that the Gods had no wants, and that those who had
      least came nearest to the Gods.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_86"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> By
      Antisthenes, these qualities were exhibited in eminent measure;
      and by his disciple Diogenes <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page151" id="v1page151"></a>151</span>they were still
      farther exaggerated. Epiktetus, a warm admirer of both, considers
      them as following up the mission from Zeus which Sokrates (in the
      Platonic Apology) sets forth as his authority, to make men
      independent of the evils of life by purifying and disciplining the
      appreciation of good and evil in the mind of each individual.<a

    <p>Antisthenes declared virtue to be the End for men to aim at &#8212; and
      to be sufficient <i>per se</i> for conferring happiness; but he
      also declared that virtue must be manifested in acts and
      character, not by words. Neither much discourse nor much learning
      was required for virtue; nothing else need be postulated except
      bodily strength like that of Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_88"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> He
      undervalued theory even in regard to Ethics: much more in regard
      to Nature (Physics) and to Logic: he also despised literary,
      geometrical, musical teaching, as distracting men&#8217;s attention from
      the regulation of their own appreciative sentiment, and the
      adaptation of their own conduct to it. He maintained strenuously
      (what several Platonic dialogues call in question) that virtue
      both could be taught and must be taught: when once learnt, it was
      permanent, and could not be eradicated. He prescribed the simplest
      mode of life, the reduction of wants to a minimum, with perfect
      indifference to enjoyment, wealth, or power. The reward was,
      exemption from fear, anxiety, disappointments, and wants: together
      with the pride of approximation to the Gods.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_89" href="#Footnotev1_3_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a>
      Though Antisthenes thus despised both literature and theory, yet
      he had obtained a rhetorical education, and had even heard the
      rhetor Gorgias. He composed a large number of dialogues and other
      treatises, of which only the titles (very multifarious) are
      preserved to us.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_90" href="#Footnotev1_3_90"><span
          class="sp">90</span></a> One dialogue, entitled Sathon, was a
      coarse attack on Plato: several treated of Homer and of other
      poets, whose verses he seems to have allegorised. Some of his
      dialogues are also declared by Athen&aelig;us to contain
      slanderous abuse of Alkibiades and other leading Athenians. <span

        &#8000;&#968;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#962;, in Sophist. 251. Schleiermacher and other commentators
        think that he intends to attack Antisthenes in Phil&ecirc;bus,
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Euthyd&ecirc;mus, &amp;c. But this seems
        to me not certain. In Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 44, he can hardly
        include Antisthenes among the &#956;&#940;&#955;&#945; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957;.
        Antisthenes neglected the study of &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;.</p>

        with Sokrates &#8212; Xenophontic Symposion.</span> </p>
    <p>Antisthenes was among the most constant friends and followers of
      Sokrates, both in his serious and in his playful colloquies.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_92" href="#Footnotev1_3_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a>
      The Symposion of Xenophon describes both of them, in their hours
      of joviality. The picture drawn by an author, himself a friend and
      companion, exhibits Antisthenes (so far as we can interpret
      caricature and jocular inversion) as poor, self-denying, austere,
      repulsive, and disputatious &#8212; yet bold and free-spoken, careless
      of giving offence, and forcible in colloquial repartee.<a

        Xenophon, Memorab. iii. 11, 17; Symposion, ii. 10, iv. 2-3-44.
        Plutarch (Qu&aelig;st. Symp. ii. 1, 6, p. 632) and Diogenes
        Laertius (vi. 1, 15) appear to understand the description of
        Xenophon as ascribing to Antisthenes a winning and conciliatory
        manner. To me it conveys the opposite impression. We must
        recollect that the pleasantry of the Xenophontic Symposion (not
        very successful as pleasantry) is founded on the assumption, by
        each person, of qualities and pretensions the direct reverse of
        that which he has in reality &#8212; and on his professing to be proud
        of that which is a notorious disadvantage. Thus Sokrates
        pretends to possess great personal beauty, and even puts himself
        in competition with the handsome youth Kritobulus; he also
        prides himself on the accomplishments of a good &#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#972;&#962;.
        Antisthenes, quite indigent, boasts of his wealth; the neglected
        Hermogenes boasts of being powerfully friended. The passage, iv.
        57, 61, which talks of the winning manners of Antisthenes, and
        his power of imparting popular accomplishments, is to be
        understood in this ironical and inverted sense.</p>

        His Cynical perfection &#8212; striking effect which he produced. </span></p>
    <p>In all these qualities, however, Antisthenes was surpassed by his
      pupil and successor Diogenes of Sin&ocirc;p&ecirc;; whose
      ostentatious austerity of life, eccentric and fearless character,
      indifference to what was considered as decency, great acuteness
      and still greater power of expression, freedom of speech towards
      all and against all &#8212; constituted him the perfect type of the
      Cynical sect. Being the son of a money-agent at
      Sin&ocirc;p&ecirc;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page153"
          id="v1page153"></a>153</span> he was banished with his father
      for fraudulently counterfeiting the coin of the city. On coming to
      Athens as an exile, he was captivated with the character of
      Antisthenes, who was at first unwilling to admit him, and was only
      induced to do so by his invincible importunity. Diogenes welcomed
      his banishment, with all its poverty and destitution, as having
      been the means of bringing him to Antisthenes,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_94" href="#Footnotev1_3_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a>
      and to a life of philosophy. It was Antisthenes (he said) who
      emancipated him from slavery, and made him a freeman. He was
      clothed in one coarse garment with double fold: he adopted the
      wallet (afterwards the symbol of cynicism) for his provisions, and
      is said to have been without any roof or lodging &#8212; dwelling
      sometimes in a tub near the Metroon, sometimes in one of the
      public porticoes or temples: he is also said to have satisfied all
      his wants in the open day. He here indulged unreservedly in that
      unbounded freedom of speech, which he looked upon as the greatest
      blessing of life. No man ever turned that blessing to greater
      account: the string of repartees, sarcasms, and stinging reproofs,
      which are attributed to him by Diogenes Laertius, is very long,
      but forms only a small proportion of those which that author had
      found recounted.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_95" href="#Footnotev1_3_95"><span
          class="sp">95</span></a> Plato described Diogenes as Sokrates
      running mad:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_96" href="#Footnotev1_3_96"><span

          name="v1page154" id="v1page154"></a>154</span>Diogenes,
      meeting some Sicilian guests at his house and treading upon his
      best carpet, exclaimed &#8220;I am treading on Plato&#8217;s empty vanity and
      conceit,&#8221; Plato rejoined &#8220;Yes, with a different vanity of your
      own&#8221;. The impression produced by Diogenes in conversation with
      others, was very powerfully felt both by young and old. Phokion,
      as well as Stilpon, were among his hearers.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_97" href="#Footnotev1_3_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a>
      In crossing the sea to &AElig;gina, Diogenes was captured by
      pirates, taken to Krete, and there put up to auction as a slave:
      the herald asked him what sort of work he was fit for: whereupon
      Diogenes replied &#8212; To command men. At his own instance, a rich
      Corinthian named Xeniades bought him and transported him to
      Corinth. Diogenes is said to have assumed towards Xeniades the air
      of a master: Xeniades placed him at the head of his household, and
      made him preceptor of his sons. In both capacities Diogenes
      discharged his duty well.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_98"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a> As a
      slave well treated by his master, and allowed to enjoy great
      freedom of speech, he lived in greater comfort than he had ever
      enjoyed as a freeman: and we are not surprised that he declined
      the offers of friends to purchase his liberation. He died at
      Corinth in very old age: it is said, at ninety years old, and on
      the very same day on which Alexander the Great died at Babylon (<span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> 323). He was buried at the gate of
      Corinth leading to the Isthmus: a monument being erected to his
      honour, with a column of Parian marble crowned by the statue of a
      dog.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_99" href="#Footnotev1_3_99"><span

      <p>The interpretation given of the passage by Plutarch is curious,
        but quite in the probable meaning of the author. However, it is
        not easy to reconcile with the fact of this extreme poverty
        another fact mentioned about Diogenes, that he asked fees from
        listeners, in one case as much as a mina (Diog. L. vi. 2, 67).</p>

        Compare Dion Chrysostom. Or. ix. (vol. i. 288 seq. Reiske) for

    <p>In politics, ethics, and rules for human conduct, Diogenes
      adopted views of his own, and spoke them out freely. He was a
      freethinker (like Antisthenes) as to the popular religion: and he
      disapproved of marriage laws, considering that the intercourse of
      the sexes <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page155"
          id="v1page155"></a>155</span>ought to be left to individual
      taste and preference.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_100"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a> Though
      he respected the city and conformed to its laws, yet he had no
      reverence for existing superstitions, or for the received usages
      as to person, sex, or family. He declared himself to be a citizen
      of the Kosmos and of Nature.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_101"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a> His
      sole exigency was, independence of life, and freedom of speech:
      having these, he was satisfied, fully sufficient to himself for
      happiness, and proud of his own superiority to human weakness. The
      main benefit which he derived from philosophy (he said) was, that
      he was prepared for any fortune that might befall him. To be ready
      to accept death easily, was the sure guarantee of a free and
      independent life.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_102"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a> He
      insisted emphatically upon the necessity of exercise or training
      (&#7940;&#963;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;) both as to the body and as to the mind. Without this,
      nothing could be done: by means of it everything might be
      achieved. But he required that the labours imposed should be
      directed to the acquisition of habits really useful; instead of
      being wasted, as they commonly were, upon objects frivolous and
      showy. The truly wise man ought to set before him as a model the
      laborious life of H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s: and he would find, after
      proper practice and training, that the contempt of pleasures would
      afford him more enjoyment than the pleasures themselves.<a

        Diogenes, especially for his consistency in acting out his own
        ethical creed. </span></p>
    <p>Diogenes declared that education was sobriety to the young,
      consolation to the old, wealth to the poor, ornament to the rich.
      But he despised much of what was commonly imparted as education &#8212;
      music, geometry, astronomy, &amp;c.: and he treated with equal
      scorn Plato and Eukleides.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_104"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a> He is

          class="sp">105</span></a> without <span class="pagenum"><a

      departure from the received usage. He caused them to undergo
      moderate exercise (not with a view to athletic success) in the
      pal&aelig;stra, and afterwards to practise riding, shooting with
      the bow, hurling the javelin, slinging and hunting: he cultivated
      their memories assiduously, by recitations from poets and prose
      authors, and even from his own compositions: he kept them on bread
      and water, without tunic or shoes, with clothing only such as was
      strictly necessary, with hair closely cut, habitually silent, and
      fixing their eyes on the ground when they walked abroad. These
      latter features approximate to the training at Sparta (as
      described by Xenophon) which Diogenes declared to contrast with
      Athens as the apartments of the men with those of the women.
      Diogenes is said to have composed several dialogues and even some
      tragedies.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_106" href="#Footnotev1_3_106"><span
          class="sp">106</span></a> But his most impressive display
      (like that of Sokrates) was by way of colloquy &#8212; prompt and
      incisive interchange of remarks. He was one of the few
      philosophers who copied Sokrates in living constantly before the
      public &#8212; in talking with every one indiscriminately and
      fearlessly, in putting home questions like a physician to his
      patient.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_107" href="#Footnotev1_3_107"><span
          class="sp">107</span></a> Epikt&ecirc;tus, &#8212; speaking of
      Diogenes as equal, if not superior, to Sokrates &#8212; draws a
      distinction pertinent and accurate. &#8220;To Sokrates&#8221; (says he) &#8220;Zeus
      assigned the elenchtic or cross-examining function: to Diogenes,
      the magisterial and chastising function: to Zeno (the Stoic) the
      didactic and dogmatical.&#8221; While thus describing Diogenes justly
      enough, Epiktetus nevertheless insists upon his agreeable person
      and his extreme gentleness and good-nature:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_108" href="#Footnotev1_3_108"><span
          class="sp">108</span></a> qualities for which <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page157" id="v1page157"></a>157</span>probably



      Diogenes neither took credit himself, nor received credit from his
      contemporaries. Diogenes seems to have really possessed &#8212; that
      which his teacher Antisthenes postulated as indispensable &#8212; the
      Sokratic physical strength and vigour. His ethical creed, obtained
      from Antisthenes, was adopted by many successors, and (in the
      main) by Zeno and the Stoics in the ensuing century. But the
      remarkable feature in Diogenes which attracts to him the
      admiration of Epikt&ecirc;tus, is &#8212; that he set the example of
      acting out his creed, consistently and resolutely, in his manner
      of life:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_109" href="#Footnotev1_3_109"><span
          class="sp">109</span></a> an example followed by some of his
      immediate successors, but not by the Stoics, who confined
      themselves to writing and preaching. Contemporary both with Plato
      and Aristotle, Diogenes stands to both of them in much the same
      relation as Phokion to Demosthenes in politics and oratory: he
      exhibits strength of will, insensibility to applause as well as to
      reproach, and self-acting independence &#8212; in antithesis to their
      higher gifts and cultivation of intellect. He was undoubtedly,
      next to Sokrates, the most original and unparalleled manifestation
      of Hellenic philosophy. </p>

        Cicero, in his Oration in defence of Murena (30-61-62)
        compliments Cato (the accuser) as one of the few persons who

        did really act them out &#8212; &#8220;H&aelig;c homo ingeniosissimus M.

      <p>M. Gaston Boissier (&Eacute;tude sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de
        Varron, pp. 113-114, Paris, 1861) expresses an amount of
        surprise which I should not have expected, on the fact that
        persons adopted a philosophical creed for the purpose only of
        debating it and defending it, and not of acting it out. But he
        recognises the fact, in regard to Varro and his contemporaries,
        in terms not less applicable to the Athenian world: amidst such
        general practice, Antisthenes, Diogenes, Krates, &amp;c., stood
        out as memorable exceptions. &#8220;Il ne faut pas non plus oublier de
        quelle mani&egrave;re, et dans quel esprit, les Romains

    <p>Respecting Diogenes and the Cynic philosophers generally, we have
      to regard not merely their doctrines, but the effect produced by
      their severity of life. In this point Diogenes surpassed his
      master Antisthenes, whose life he criticised as not fully
      realising the lofty spirit of his doctrine. The spectacle of man
      not merely abstaining from enjoyment, but enduring with
      indifference hunger, thirst, heat, cold, poverty, privation,
      bodily torture, death, &amp;c., exercises a powerful influence on
      the imagination of mankind. <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page158" id="v1page158"></a>158</span>It calls forth
      strong feelings of reverence and admiration in the beholders:
      while in the sufferer himself also, self-reverence and
      self-admiration, the sense of power and exaltation above the
      measure of humanity, is largely developed. The extent to which
      self-inflicted hardships and pains have prevailed in various
      regions of the earth, the long-protracted and invincible
      resolution with which they have been endured, and the veneration
      which such practices have procured for the ascetics who submitted
      to them are among the most remarkable chapters in history.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_110" href="#Footnotev1_3_110"><span
          class="sp">110</span></a> The East, especially India, has
      always been, and still is, the country in which these voluntary
      endurances have reached their extreme pitch of severity; even
      surpassing those of the Christian monks in Egypt and Syria, during
      the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era.<a

          class="sp">111</span></a> When Alexander the Great first
      opened India to the observation of Greeks, one of the novelties
      which most surprised him and his followers was, the sight of the
      Gymnosophists or naked philosophers. These men were found lying on
      the ground, either totally uncovered or with nothing but a cloth
      round the loins; abstaining from all enjoyment, nourishing
      themselves upon a minimum of coarse vegetables or fruits, careless
      of the extreme heat of the plain, and the extreme cold of the
      mountain; and often superadding pain, fatigue, or prolonged and
      distressing uniformity of posture. They passed their time either
      in silent meditation or in discourse on religion and philosophy:
      they were venerated as well as consulted by every one, censuring
      even the most powerful persons in the land. Their fixed idea was
      to stand as examples to all, of endurance, insensibility,
      submission only to the indispensable necessities of nature, and
      freedom from all other fear or authority. They acted out the
      doctrine, which Plato so eloquently preaches <span

      the name of Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;don &#8212; That the whole life of
      the philosopher is a preparation for death: that life is
      worthless, and death an escape from it into a better state.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_112" href="#Footnotev1_3_112"><span
          class="sp">112</span></a> It is an interesting fact to learn
      that when Onesikritus (one of Alexander&#8217;s officers, who had known
      and frequented the society of Diogenes in Greece), being
      despatched during the Macedonian march through India for the
      purpose of communicating with these Gymnosophists, saw their
      manner of life and conversed with them he immediately compared
      them with Diogenes, whom he had himself visited &#8212; as well as with
      Sokrates and Pythagoras, whom he knew by reputation. Onesikritus
      described to the Gymnosophists the manner of life of Diogenes: but
      Diogenes wore a threadbare mantle, and this appeared to them a
      mark of infirmity and imperfection. They remarked that Diogenes
      was right to a considerable extent; but wrong for obeying
      convention in preference to nature, and for being ashamed of going

      <p>The work of August Gladitsch (Einleitung in das
        Verst&auml;ndniss der Weltgeschichte, Posen, 1841) contains an
        instructive comparison between the Gymnosophists and the Cynics,
        as well as between the Pythagoreans and the Chinese philosophers
        &#8212; between the Eleatic sect and the Hindoo philosophers. The
        points of analogy, both in doctrine and practice, are very
        numerous and strikingly brought out, pp. 356-377. I cannot,
        however, agree in his conclusion, that the doctrines and
        practice of Antisthenes were borrowed, not from Sokrates with
        exaggeration, but from the Parmenidean theory, and the Vedanta
        theory of the Ens Unum, leading to negation and contempt of the
        phenomenal world.</p>

    <p>These observations of the Indian Gymnosophist are a reproduction
      and an application in practice<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_114"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a> of the
      memorable declaration of principle enunciated by Sokrates &#8212; &#8220;That
      the Gods had no wants: and that the man who had fewest wants,
      approximated most nearly to the Gods&#8221;. This principle is first
      introduced into Grecian ethics by Sokrates: ascribed to him both
      by Xenophon and Plato, and seemingly approved by both. In his
      life, too, Sokrates carried the principle into effect, up to a
      certain point. Both admirers and opponents attest his poverty,
      hard fare, coarse clothing, endurance of cold and privation:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_115" href="#Footnotev1_3_115"><span
          class="sp">115</span></a> but he was a family man, with a wife
      and children to maintain, and he partook occasionally, of
      indulgences which made him fall short of his own ascetic
      principle. Plato and Xenophon &#8212; both of them well-born Athenians,
      in circumstances affluent, or at least easy, the latter being a
      knight, and even highly skilled in horses and horsemanship &#8212;
      contented themselves with preaching on the text, whenever they had
      to deal with an opponent more self-indulgent than themselves; but
      made no attempt to carry it into practice.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_116" href="#Footnotev1_3_116"><span
          class="sp">116</span></a> Zeno the Stoic laid down broad
      principles of self-denial and apathy: but in practice he was
      unable to conquer the sense of shame, as the Cynics did, and still
      more the Gymnosophists. Antisthenes, on the other hand, took to
      heart, both in word and act, the principle <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page161" id="v1page161"></a>161</span>of Sokrates: yet
      even he, as we know from the Xenophontic Symposion, was not
      altogether constant in rigorous austerity. His successors Diogenes
      and Krates attained the maximum of perfection ever displayed by
      the Cynics of free Greece. They stood forth as examples of
      endurance, abnegation &#8212; insensibility to shame and fear &#8212;
      free-spoken censure of others. Even they however were not so
      recognised by the Indian Gymnosophists; who, having reduced their
      wants, their fears, and their sensibilities, yet lower, had thus
      come nearer to that which they called the perfection of Nature,
      and which Sokrates called the close approach to divinity.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_117" href="#Footnotev1_3_117"><span
          class="sp">117</span></a> When Alexander the Great (in the
      first year of his reign and prior to any of his Asiatic conquests)
      visited Diogenes at Corinth, found him lying in the sun, and asked
      if there was anything which he wanted &#8212; Diogenes made the
      memorable reply &#8212; &#8220;Only that you and your guards should stand out
      of my sunshine&#8221;. This reply doubtless manifests the self-satisfied
      independence of the philosopher. Yet it is far less impressive
      than the fearless reproof which the Indian Gymnosophists
      administered to Alexander, when they saw him in the Punjab at the
      head of his victorious army, after exploits, dangers, and fatigues
      almost superhuman, as conqueror of Persia and acknowledged son of
      Zeus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_118" href="#Footnotev1_3_118"><span

        Onesikritus observes, respecting the Indian Gymnosophists, that
        &#8220;they were more striking in act than in discourse&#8221; (&#7952;&#957; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962;
        &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#954;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7970; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, Strabo, xv. 713 B); and
        this is true about the Cynic succession of philosophers, in
        Greece as well as in Rome. Diogenes Laertius (compare his
        prooem, s. 19, 20, and vi. 103) ranks the Cynic philosophy as a
        distinct &#945;&#7989;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;: but he tells us that other writers (especially
        Hippobotus) would not reckon it as an &#945;&#7989;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, but only as an
        &#7956;&#957;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#946;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#8212; practice without theory.</p>

        draws between Stoic and Cynic (De Brevitat. Vit&aelig;, 14, 5).
        His admiration for the &#8220;seminudus&#8221; Cynic Demetrius, his
        contemporary and companion, was extreme (Epist. 62, 2, and

        Cicero, Tusc. Disp. v. 32, 92, and the Anabasis of Arrian, vii.
        1-2-3, where both the reply of Diogenes and that of the Indian
        Gymnosophists are reported. Dion Chrysostom (Orat. iv. p. 145
        seq. Reiske) gives a prolix dialogue between Alexander and
        Diogenes. His picture of the effect produced by Diogenes upon
        the different spectators at the Isthmian festival, is striking
        and probable. </p>
      <p>Kalanus, one of the Indian Gymnosophists, was persuaded, by the
        instances of Alexander, to abandon his Indian mode of life and
        to come away with the Macedonian army &#8212; very much to the disgust
        of his brethren, who scornfully denounced him as infirm and even
        as the slave of appetite (&#7936;&#954;&#972;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;, Strabo, xv. 718). He was
        treated with the greatest consideration and respect by Alexander
        and his officers; yet when the army came into Persis, he became
        sick of body and tired of life. He obtained the reluctant
        consent of Alexander to allow him to die. A funeral pile was
        erected, upon which he voluntarily burnt himself in presence of
        the whole army; who witnessed the scene with every demonstration
        of military honour. See the remarkable description in Arrian,
        Anab. vii. 3. Cicero calls him &#8220;Indus indoctus ac barbarus&#8221;
        (Tusc. Disp. ii. 22, 52); but the impression which he made on
        Alexander himself, Onesikritus, Lysimachus, and generally upon
        all who saw him, was that of respectful admiration (Strabo, xv.
        715; Arrian, l. c.). One of these Indian sages, who had come
        into Syria along with the Indian envoys sent by an Indian king
        to the Roman Emperor Augustus, burnt himself publicly at Athens,
        with an exulting laugh when he leaped upon the funeral pile
        (Strabo, xv. 720 A) &#8212; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7992;&#957;&#948;&#8182;&#957; &#7956;&#952;&#951;. </p>
      <p>The like act of self-immolation was performed by the Grecian
        Cynic Peregrinus Proteus, at the Olympic festival in the reign
        of Marcus Antoninus, 165 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> (See
        Clinton, Fasti Romani.) Lucian, who was present and saw the
        proceeding, has left an animated description of it, but
        ridicules it as a piece of silly vanity. Theagenes, the admiring
        disciple of Peregrinus, and other Cynics, who were present in
        considerable numbers &#8212; and also Lucian himself compare this act
        to that of the Indian Gymnosophists &#8212; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#962;

        or Convention &#8212; insisted on by the Indian Gymnosophists. </span></p>
    <p>Another point, in the reply made by the Indian Gymnosophist to
      Onesikritus, deserves notice: I mean the antithesis between law
      (or convention) and nature (&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#8212; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;) &#8212; the supremacy which
      he asserts for Nature over law &#8212; and the way in which he
      understands Nature and her supposed ordinances. This antithesis
      was often put forward and argued in the ancient Ethics: and it is
      commonly said, without any sufficient proof, that the Sophists
      (speaking of them collectively) recognised only the authority of
      law &#8212; while Sokrates and Plato had the merit of vindicating
      against them the superior authority of Nature. The Indian
      Gymnosophist agrees with the Athenian speaker in the Platonic
      treatise De Legibus, and with the Platonic Kallikles in the
      Gorgias, thus far &#8212; that he upholds the paramount authority of
      Nature. But of these three interpreters, each hears and reports
      the oracles of Nature differently from the other two: and there
      are many other dissenting interpreters besides.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_119" href="#Footnotev1_3_119"><span
          class="sp">119</span></a> Which of them are we to follow? And
      if, adopting any one of them, we reject the others, upon what
      grounds are we to justify our preference? When the Gymnosophist
      points out, that nakedness is the natural condition of man; when
      he farther infers, that because natural it is therefore right and
      that the wearing of clothes, being a departure from nature, is
      also a departure from right &#8212; how are we to prove to him that his
      interpretation of nature is the wrong one? These questions have
      received no answer in any of the Platonic dialogues: though we
      have seen that Plato is very bitter against those who dwell upon
      the antithesis between Law and Nature, and who undertake to decide
      between the two. </p>

        Though Seneca (De Brevitate Vit. 14) talks of the Stoics as
        &#8220;conquering Nature, and the Cynics as exceeding Nature,&#8221; yet the
        Stoic Epikt&ecirc;tus considers his morality as the only scheme
        conformable to Nature (Epikt&ecirc;t. Diss. iv. 1, 121-128);
        while the Epikurean Lucretius claims the same conformity for the
        precepts of Epikurus.</p>

        ascetic or mendicant friars. </span></p>
    <p>Reverting to the Cynics, we must declare them to be in one
      respect the most peculiar outgrowth of Grecian philosophy: because
      they are not merely a doctrinal sect, with phrases, theories,
      reasonings, and teachings, of their own &#8212; but still more
      prominently a body of practical ascetics, a mendicant order<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_120" href="#Footnotev1_3_120"><span
          class="sp">120</span></a> in philosophy, working up the
      bystanders by exhibiting themselves as models of endurance and
      apathy. These peculiarities seem to have originated partly with
      Pythagoras, partly with Sokrates &#8212; for there is no known prior
      example of it in Grecian history, except that of the anomalous
      priests of Zeus at Dodona, called Selli, who lay on the ground
      with unwashed feet. The discipline of Lykurgus at Sparta included
      severe endurance; but then it was intended to form, and actually
      did form, good soldiers. The Cynics had no view to military
      action. They exaggerated the peculiarities of Sokrates, and we
      should call their mode of life the Sokratic life, if we followed
      the example of those who gave names to the Pythagorean or Orphic
      life, as a set of observances derived from the type of Pythagoras
      or Orpheus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_121" href="#Footnotev1_3_121"><span

      <p>There is no analogy in Grecian history to illustrate this very
        curious passage: the Excursus of Heyne furnishes no information
        (see his edition of the Iliad, vol. vii. p. 289) except the
        general remark:&#8212;&#8220;Selli &#8212; vit&aelig; genus et institutum

      with Plato; whose opinions he impugned in an express dialogue
      entitled Sathon. Plato on his side attacked the opinions of
      Antisthenes, and spoke contemptuously of his intelligence, yet
      without formally naming him. At least there are some criticisms in
      the Platonic dialogues (especially in the Sophist&ecirc;s, p. 251)
      which the commentators pronounce, on strong grounds, to be aimed
      at Antisthenes: who is also unfavourably criticised by Aristotle.
      We know but little of the points which Antisthenes took up against
      Plato and still less of the reasons which he urged in support of
      them. Both he and Diogenes, however, are said to have declared
      express war against the Platonic theory of self-existent Ideas.
      The functions of general Concepts and general propositions,
      together with the importance of defining general terms, had been
      forcibly insisted on in the colloquies of Sokrates; and his
      disciple Plato built upon this foundation the memorable hypothesis
      of an aggregate of eternal, substantive realities, called Ideas or
      Forms, existing separate from the objects of sense, yet affording
      a certain participation in themselves to those objects: not
      discernible by sense, but only by the Reason or understanding.
      These bold creations of the Platonic fancy were repudiated by
      Antisthenes and Diogenes: who are both said to have declared &#8220;We
      see Man, and we see Horse; but Manness and Horseness we do not
      see&#8221;. Whereunto Plato replied &#8220;You possess that eye by which Horse
      is seen: but you have not yet acquired that eye by which Horseness
      is seen&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_123" href="#Footnotev1_3_123"><span

        Realism. </span></p>
    <p>This debate between Antisthenes and Plato marks an interesting
      point in the history of philosophy. It is the first protest of
      Nominalism against the doctrine of an extreme Realism. The Ideas
      or Forms of Plato (according to many of his phrases, for he is not
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page165" id="v1page165"></a>165</span>always



      consistent with himself) are not only real existences distinct
      from particulars, but absorb to themselves all the reality of
      particulars. The real universe in the Platonic theory was composed
      of Ideas or Forms such as Manness or Horseness<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_124" href="#Footnotev1_3_124"><span
          class="sp">124</span></a> (called by Plato the &#913;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;-&#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;
      and &#913;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;-&#7997;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;), of which particular men and horses were only
      disfigured, transitory, and ever-varying photographs. Antisthenes
      denied what Plato affirmed, and as Plato affirmed it. Aristotle
      denied it also; maintaining that genera, species, and attributes,
      though distinguishable as separate predicates of, or inherencies
      in, individuals &#8212; yet had no existence apart from individuals.
      Aristotle was no less wanting than Antisthenes, in the
      intellectual eye required for discerning the Platonic Ideas.
      Antisthenes is said to have declared these Ideas to be mere
      thoughts or conceptions (&#968;&#953;&#955;&#8048;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#945;&#962;): <i>i.e.</i>, merely
      subjective or within the mind, without any object corresponding to
      them. This is one of the various modes of presenting the theory of
      Ideas, resorted to even in the Platonic Parmenid&ecirc;s, not by
      one who opposes that theory, but by one seeking to defend it &#8212; <i>viz.</i>,
      by Sokrates, when he is hard pressed by the objections of the
      Eleate against the more extreme and literal version of the theory.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_125" href="#Footnotev1_3_125"><span
          class="sp">125</span></a> It is remarkable, that the
      objections ascribed to Parmenides against that version which
      exhibits the Ideas as mere Concepts of and in the mind, are
      decidedly less forcible than those which he urges against the
      other versions. </p>

        We know from Plato himself (The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, p. 182 A)
        that even the word &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, if not actually first introduced by
        himself, was at any rate so recent as to be still repulsive, and

        &#7985;&#960;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; would be still more strange. Antisthenes probably
        invented them, to present the doctrine which he impugned in a
        dress of greater seeming absurdity.</p>

    <p>There is another singular doctrine, which Aristotle ascribes to
      Antisthenes, and which Plato notices and confutes; alluding to its
      author contemptuously, but not mentioning his name. Every name

      essence of the thing named, and differing from every other word:
      you cannot therefore truly predicate any one word of any other,
      because the reason or meaning of the two is different: there can
      be no true propositions except identical propositions, in which
      the predicate is the same with the subject &#8212; &#8220;man is man, good is
      good&#8221;. &#8220;Man is good&#8221; was an inadmissible proposition: affirming
      different things to be the same, or one thing to be many.<a

      two speakers really to contradict each other. There can be no

      one speaker declares the essence of one thing, and another speaker

          class="sp">130</span></a> in reciting this doctrine of Stilpon
      (which had been vehemently impugned by the Epikurean
      Kol&ocirc;t&ecirc;s), declares it to have been intended only in
      jest. There is no ground for believing that it was so intended:

        Aristotle (Met. &#916;. 1024) represents the doctrine of Antisthenes,
        That contradictory and false propositions are impossible &#8212; as a
        consequence deduced from the position laid down &#8212; That no
        propositions except identical propositions were admissible. If
        you grant this last proposition, the consequences will be
        undeniable. Possibly Antisthenes may have reasoned in this way:
        &#8220;There are many contradictory and false propositions now afloat;
        but this arises from the way in which predication is conducted.
        So long as the predicate is different from the subject, there is
        nothing <i>in the form of a proposition</i> to distinguish
        falsehood from truth (to distinguish <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
          sedet</i>, from <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus volat</i> &#8212; to take
        the instance in the Platonic Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212; p. 263). There
        ought to be no propositions except identical propositions: the
        form itself will then guarantee you against both falsehood and
        contradiction: you will be sure always to give &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957;
        &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;.&#8221; There would be nothing inconsistent in such a
        precept: but Aristotle might call it silly &#949;&#8016;&#951;&#952;&#8182;&#962;), because,
        while shutting out falsehood and contradiction, it would also
        shut out the great body of useful truth, and would divest
        language of its usefulness as a means of communication. </p>
      <p>Brandis (Gesch. der Gr. R&ouml;misch. Phil. vol. ii. xciii. 1)
        gives something like this as the probable purpose of Antisthenes
        &#8212; &#8220;Nur Eins bezeichne die Wesenheit eines Dinges &#8212; die Wesenheit
        als einfachen Tr&auml;ger des mannichfaltigen der Eigenschaften&#8221;
        (this is rather too Aristotelian) &#8212; &#8220;zur Abwehr von
        Streitigkeiten auf dem Gebiete der Erscheinungen&#8221;. Compare also
        Ritter, Gesch. Phil. vol. ii. p. 130. We read in the Kratylus,
        that there were persons who maintained the rectitude of all
        names: to say that a name was not right, was (in their view)
        tantamount to saying that it was no name at all, but only an
        unmeaning sound (Plato, Krat. pp. 429-430).</p>

      objection. He pronounced them to be inadmissible both as subject
      and as predicate. If you speak of Man in general (he said), what,
      or whom, do you mean? You do not mean A or B, or C or D, &amp;c.:
      that is, you do not mean any one of these more than any other. You
      have no determinate meaning at all: and beyond this indefinite
      multitude of individuals, there is nothing that the term can mean.
      Again, as to predicates &#8212; when you say, <i>The man runs</i>, or <i>The



        man is good</i>, what do you mean by the predicate <i>runs</i>,
      or is <i>good</i>? You do not mean any thing specially belonging
      to man: for you apply the same predicates to many other subjects:
      you <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page168" id="v1page168"></a>168</span>say



      <i>runs</i>, about a horse, a dog, or a cat &#8212; you say <i>good</i>
      in reference to food, medicine, and other things besides. Your
      predicate, therefore, being applied to many and diverse subjects,
      belongs not to one of them more than to another: in other words,
      it belongs to neither: the predication is not admissible.<a

        Hegel (Geschichte der Griech. Philos. i. p. 123) and Marbach
        (Geschichte der Philos. s. 91) disallow the assertion of

        Stilpon rejected the particular affirmations, and allowed only
        general or universal affirmations. This construction appears to
        me erroneous.</p>

      <p>Sextus Empiricus (adv. Mathem. vii. p. 269-282) gives a
        different vein of reasoning respecting predication, &#8212; yet a view
        which illustrates this doctrine of Antisthenes. Sextus does not
        require that all predication shall be restricted to identical
        predication: but he maintains that you cannot define any general
        word. To define, he says, is to enunciate the essence of that
        which is defined. But when you define Man &#8212; &#8220;a mortal, rational
        animal, capable of reason and knowledge&#8221; &#8212; you give only certain
        attributes of Man, which go along with the essence &#8212; you do not
        give the essence itself. If you enumerate even all the
        accompaniments (&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;), you will still fail to tell me
        what the essence of Man is: which is what I desire to know, and
        what you profess to do by your definition. It is useless to
        enumerate accompaniments, until you explain to me what the
        essence is which they accompany. </p>
      <p>These are ingenious objections, which seem to me quite valid,
        if you assume the logical subject to be a real, absolute
        essence, apart from all or any of its predicates. And this is a
        frequent illusion, favoured even by many logicians. We enunciate
        the subject first, then the predicate; and because the subject
        can be conceived after abstraction of this, that, <i>or</i> the
        other predicates &#8212; we are apt to imagine that it may be
        conceived without <i>all or any</i> of the predicates. But this
        is an illusion. If you suppress all predicates, the subject or
        supposed substratum vanishes along with them: just as the Genus
        vanishes, if you suppress all the different species of it. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Scais-tu au moins ce que c&#8217;est que la mati&egrave;re?
        Tr&egrave;s-bien.&#8230; Par exemple, cette pierre est grise, est
        d&#8217;une telle forme, a ses trois dimensions; elle est
        p&eacute;sante et divisible. Eh bien (dit le Sirien), cette
        chose qui te paro&icirc;t &ecirc;tre divisible, p&eacute;sante,
        et grise, me dirois tu bien ce que c&#8217;est? Tu vois quelques
        attributs: mais le fond de la chose, le connois tu? Non, dit
        l&#8217;autre. Tu ne scais donc point ce que c&#8217;est que la
        mati&egrave;re.&#8221; (Voltaire, Microm&eacute;gas, c. 7.) </p>
      <p>&#8220;Le fond de la chose&#8221; &#8212; the Ding an sich &#8212; is nothing but the
        name itself, divested of every fraction of meaning: it is <i>titulus



          sine re</i>. But the name being familiar, and having been
        always used with a meaning, still appears invested with much of
        the old emotional associations, even though it has been stripped
        of all its meaning by successive acts of abstraction. If you
        subtract from four, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, there will remain zero. But
        by abstracting, from the subject <i>man</i>, all its
        predicates, real and possible, you cannot reduce it to zero. The
        <i>name</i> man always remains, and appears by old association
        to carry with it some meaning &#8212; though the meaning can no longer
        be defined. </p>
      <p>This illusion is well pointed out in a valuable passage of
        Cabanis (Du Degr&eacute; de Certitude de la M&eacute;decine, p.
        61):&#8212; </p>
      <p>&#8220;Je pourrois d&#8217;ailleurs demander ce qu&#8217;on entend par la nature
        et les causes premi&egrave;res des maladies. Nous connoissons de
        leur nature, ce que les faits en manifestent. Nous savons, par
        exemple, que la fi&egrave;vre produit tels et tels changements:
        ou plut&ocirc;t, c&#8217;est par ces changements qu&#8217;elle se montre
        &agrave; nos yeux: c&#8217;est <i>par eux seuls qu&#8217;elle existe pour
          nous</i>. Quand un homme tousse, crache du sang, respire avec
        peine, ressent une douleur de c&ocirc;t&eacute;, a le pouls plus
        vite et plus dur, la peau plus chaude que dans l&#8217;&eacute;tat
        naturel &#8212; l&#8217;on dit qu&#8217;il est attaqu&eacute; d&#8217;une
        pleur&eacute;sie. Mais qu&#8217;est ce donc <i>qu&#8217;une
          pleur&eacute;sie</i>? On vous r&eacute;pliquera que c&#8217;est une
        maladie, dans laquelle tous, ou presque tous, ces accidents se
        trouvent combin&eacute;s. S&#8217;il en manque un ou plusieurs, ce
        n&#8217;est point la pleur&eacute;sie, du moins la vraie
        pleur&eacute;sie essentielle des &eacute;coles. <i>C&#8217;est donc
          le concours de ces accidents qui la constitue.</i> Le mot <i>pleur&eacute;sie



          ne fait que les retracer d&#8217;une mani&egrave;re plus courte. Ce
          mot n&#8217;est pas un &ecirc;tre par lui-m&ecirc;me</i>: il exprime
        une abstraction de l&#8217;esprit, et r&eacute;veille par un seul
        trait toutes les images d&#8217;un assez grand tableau. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Ainsi lorsque, non content de conno&icirc;tre une maladie par
        ce qu&#8217;elle offre &agrave; nos sens, par ce qui seul la
        constitue, et sans quoi elle n&#8217;existeroit pas, <i>vous demandez
          encore quelle est sa nature en elle-m&ecirc;me, quelle est son
          essence &#8212; c&#8217;est comme si vous demandiez quelle est la nature
          ou l&#8217;essence d&#8217;un mot, d&#8217;une pure abstraction.</i> Il n&#8217;y a
        donc pas beaucoup de justesse &agrave; dire, d&#8217;un air de
        triomphe, que les m&eacute;decins ignorent m&ecirc;me la nature
        de la fi&egrave;vre, et que sans cesse ils agissent dans des
        circonstances, ou manient des instruments, dont l&#8217;essence leur
        est inconnue.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Stilpon (like Antisthenes, as I have remarked above) seems to
      have had in his mind a type of predication, similar to the type of
      reasoning which Aristotle laid down the syllogism: such that the
      form of the proposition should be itself a guarantee for the truth
      of what was affirmed. Throughout the ancient philosophy,
      especially in the more methodised debates between the Academics
      and Sceptics on one side, and the Stoics on the other &#8212; what the
      one party affirmed and the other party denied, was, the existence
      of a Criterion of Truth: some distinguishable mark, such as
      falsehood could not possibly carry. To find this infallible mark
      in propositions, Stilpon admitted none except identical. While
      agreeing with Antisthenes, that no predicate could belong to a
      subject different from itself, he added a new argument, by
      pointing out that predicates applied to one subject were also
      applied to many other subjects. Now if the predicates belonged to
      one, they could not (in his view) belong to the others: and
      therefore they did not really belong to any. He considered that
      predication involved either identity or special and exclusive
      implication of the predicate with the subject. </p>

        Platonic Parmenid&ecirc;s.</span> </p>
    <p>Stilpon was not the first who had difficulty in explaining to
      himself how one and the same predicate could be applied to many
      different subjects. The difficulty had already been set forth in
      the Platonic Parmenid&ecirc;s.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_133"

      present as a whole in each: nor can it be divided, and thus
      present partly in one, partly in another. How therefore can it be
      present at all in any of them? In other words, how can the One be
      Many, and how can the Many be One? Of this difficulty (as of many
      others) Plato presents no solution, either in the Parmenid&ecirc;s
      or anywhere else.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_134"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a>
      Aristotle alludes to several contemporaries or predecessors who
      felt it. Stilpon reproduces it in his own way. It is a very real
      difficulty, requiring to be dealt with by those who lay down a
      theory of predication; and calling upon them to explain the
      functions of general propositions, and the meaning of general
      terms. </p>

        The long commentary of Proklus (v. 100-110. pp. 670-682 of the

      <p>Lykophron and some others anterior to Aristotle proposed to
        elude the difficulty, by ceasing to use the substantive verb as
        copula in predication: instead of saying &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#962;,

      analysis, and by the definition founded thereupon, you really come
      to <i>know</i> them &#8212; describe them &#8212; predicate about them. But
      the first class, the simple or primary objects, can only be
      perceived by sense and named: they cannot be analysed, defined, or
      known. You can only predicate about them that they are like such
      and such other things: <i>e.g., silver</i>, you cannot say what
      it is in itself, but only that it is like tin, or like something
      else. There may thus be a <i>ratio</i> and a definition of any
      compound object, whether it be an object of perception or of
      conception: because one of the component elements will serve as
      Matter or Subject of the proposition, and the other as Form or
      Predicate. But there can be no definition of any one of the
      component elements separately taken: because there is neither
      Matter nor Form to become the Subject and Predicate of a defining
      proposition.&#8221; </p>

    <p>This opinion, ascribed to the followers of Antisthenes, is not in
      harmony with the opinion ascribed by Aristotle to Antisthenes
      himself (<i>viz.</i>, That no propositions, except identical
      propositions, were admissible): and we are led to suspect that the
      first opinion must have been understood or qualified by its author
      in some manner not now determinable. But the second opinion,
      drawing a marked logical distinction between simple and complex
      Objects, has some interest from the criticisms of Plato and
      Aristotle: both of whom select, for the example illustrating the
      opinion, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page172"
          id="v1page172"></a>172</span>syllable as the compound made up
      of two or more letters which are its simple constituent elements.

    </p>
    <p>Plato refutes the doctrine,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_138"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a> but in
      a manner not so much to prove its untruth, as to present it for a
      verbal incongruity. How can you properly say (he argues) that you
      <i>know</i> the compound AB, when you know neither A nor B
      separately? Now it may be incongruous to restrict in this manner
      the use of the words <i>know &#8212; knowledge</i>: but the distinction
      between the two cases is not denied by Plato. Antisthenes said &#8212;
      &#8220;I feel a simple sensation (A or B) and can name it, but I do not
      <i>know</i> it: I can affirm nothing about it in itself, or about
      its real essence. But the compound AB I do know, for I know its
      essence: I can affirm about it that <i>it is</i> compounded of A
      and B, and this is its essence.&#8221; Here is a real distinction: and
      Plato&#8217;s argument amounts only to affirming that it is an incorrect
      use of words to call the compound <i>known</i>, when the
      component elements are not known. Unfortunately the refutation of
      Plato is not connected with any declaration of his own
      counter-doctrine, for The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus ends in a result
      purely negative. </p>

    <p>Aristotle, in his comment on the opinion of Antisthenes, makes us

      (A or B), I cannot tell what they really are: but I can tell what
      they are like or unlike, <i>i.e.</i>, I can compare them with
      other essences, simple or compound. But respecting the compound
      AB, I can tell what it really is: its essence is, to be compounded
      of A and B. And this I call <i>knowing</i> or <i>knowledge</i>.&#8221;<a

      <p>Mr. J. S. Mill observes, Syst. of Logic, i. 5, 6, p. 116, ed.
        9:&#8212;&#8220;There is still another exceptional case, in which, though
        the predicate is the name of a class, yet in predicating it we
        affirm nothing but resemblance: the class being founded not on
        resemblance in any given particular, but on general unanalysable
        resemblance. The classes in question are those into which our
        simple sensations, or other simple feelings, are divided.
        Sensations of white, for instance, are classed together, not
        because we can take them to pieces, and say, they are alike in
        this, not alike in that but because we feel them to be alike
        altogether, though in different degrees. When therefore I say &#8212;
        The colour I saw yesterday was a white colour, or, The sensation
        I feel is one of tightness &#8212; in both cases the attribute I
        affirm of the colour or of the other sensation is mere
        resemblance: simple likeness to sensations which I have had
        before, and which have had that name bestowed upon them. The
        names of feelings, like other concrete general names, are
        connotative: but they connote a mere resemblance. When
        predicated of any individual feelings, the information they
        convey is that of its likeness to the other feelings which we
        have been accustomed to call by the same name.&#8221;</p>

        Hipparchia was a native of Maroneia in Thrace; born in a
        considerable station, and belonging to an opulent family. She
        came to Athens with her brother M&ecirc;trokl&ecirc;s, and heard
        both Theophrastus and Krat&ecirc;s. Both she and her brother
        became impressed with the strongest admiration for Krat&ecirc;s:
        for his mode of life, as well as for his discourses and
        doctrine. Rejecting various wealthy suitors, she insisted upon
        becoming his wife, both against his will and against the will of
        her parents. Her resolute enthusiasm overcame the reluctance of
        both. She adopted fully his hard life, poor fare, and threadbare
        cloak. She passed her days in the same discourses and
        controversies, indifferent to the taunts which were addressed to
        her for having relinquished the feminine occupations of spinning
        and weaving. Diogenes Laertius found many striking dicta or
        replies ascribed to her (&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945; &#956;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965; vi. 96-98). He
        gives an allusion made to her by the contemporary comic poet
        Menander, who (as I before observed) handled the Cynics of his
        time as Aristophanes, Eupolis, &amp;c., had handled Sokrates &#8212; </p>

    <p>Among other hearers of Krates, who carried on, and at the same

      Kitium in Cyprus, who became celebrated as the founder of the
      Stoic sect. In him the Cynic, Megaric, and Herakleitean tendencies
      may be said to have partially converged, though with considerable
      modifications:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_144" href="#Footnotev1_3_144"><span

      the logical subtleties of the others. He blended them, however,
      with much of new positive theory, both physical and cosmological.
      His compositions were voluminous; and those of the Stoic
      Chrysippus, after him, were still more numerous. The negative and
      oppugning function, which in the fourth century <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> had been directed by the Megarics
      against Aristotle, was in the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>

      Arkesilaus: whose formidable dialectic was brought to bear upon

    <p>Sokrates points out to Aristippus that mankind may be distributed
      into two classes: 1. Those who have trained themselves to habits
      of courage, energy, bodily strength, and command over their
      desires and appetites, together with practice in the actual work
      of life:&#8212;these are the men who become qualified to rule, and who
      do actually rule. 2. The rest of mankind, inferior in these
      points, who have no choice but to obey, and who do obey.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_147" href="#Footnotev1_3_147"><span
          class="sp">147</span></a> &#8212; Men of the first or ruling class
      possess all the advantages of life: they perform great exploits,
      and enjoy a full measure of delight and happiness, so far as human
      circumstances admit. Men of the second class are no better than
      slaves, always liable to suffer, and often actually suffering,
      ill-treatment and spoliation of the worst kind. To which of these
      classes (Sokrates asks Aristippus) do you calculate on belonging &#8212;
      and for which do you seek to qualify yourself? &#8212; To neither of
      them (replies Aristippus). I do not wish to share the lot of the
      subordinate multitude: but I have no relish for a life of command,
      with all the fatigues, hardships, perils, &amp;c., which are
      inseparable from it. I prefer a middle course: I wish neither to
      rule, nor to be ruled, but to be a freeman: and I consider freedom
      as the best guarantee for happiness.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_148"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_148"><span class="sp">148</span></a> I
      desire only <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page176"
          id="v1page176"></a>176</span>to pass through life as easily
      and pleasantly as possible.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_149"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_149"><span class="sp">149</span></a> &#8212; Which
      of the two do you consider to live most pleasantly, the rulers or
      the ruled? asks Sokrates. &#8212; I do not rank myself with either (says
      Aristippus): nor do I enter into active duties of citizenship
      anywhere: I pass from one city to another, but everywhere as a
      stranger or non-citizen. &#8212; Your scheme is impracticable (says
      Sokrates). You cannot obtain security in the way that you propose.
      You will find yourself suffering wrong and distress along with the
      subordinates<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_150" href="#Footnotev1_3_150"><span
          class="sp">150</span></a> &#8212; and even worse than the
      subordinates: for a stranger, wherever he goes, is less befriended
      and more exposed to injury than the native citizens. You will be
      sold into slavery, though you are fit for no sort of work: and
      your master will chastise you until you become fit for work. &#8212; But
      (replies Aristippus) this very art of ruling, which you consider
      to be happiness,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_151"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_151"><span class="sp">151</span></a> is
      itself a hard life, a toilsome slavery, not only stripped of
      enjoyment, but full of privation and suffering. A man must be a
      fool to embrace such discomforts of his own accord. &#8212; It is that
      very circumstance (says Sokrates), that he does embrace them of
      his own accord &#8212; which renders them endurable, and associates them
      with feelings of pride and dignity. They are the price paid
      beforehand, for a rich reward to come. He who goes through labour
      and self-denial, for the purpose of gaining good friends or
      subduing enemies, and for the purpose of acquiring both mental and
      bodily power, so that he may manage his own concerns well and may
      benefit both his friends and his country &#8212; such a man will be sure
      to find his course of labour pleasurable. He will pass his life in
      cheerful<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_152" href="#Footnotev1_3_152"><span
          class="sp">152</span></a> satisfaction, not only enjoying his
      own esteem and admiration, but also extolled and envied by others.
      On the contrary, whoever passes his earlier years in immediate
      pleasures and indolent ease, will <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page177" id="v1page177"></a>177</span>acquire no
      lasting benefit either in mind or body. He will have a soft lot at
      first, but his future will be hard and dreary.<a

    <p>Sokrates enforces his lecture by reciting to Aristippus the
      memorable lecture or apologue, which the Sophist Prodikus was then
      delivering in lofty diction to numerous auditors<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_154" href="#Footnotev1_3_154"><span
          class="sp">154</span></a> &#8212; the fable still known as the
      Choice of H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s. Virtue and Pleasure (the latter of
      the two being here identified with Evil or Vice) are introduced as
      competing for the direction of the youthful H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s.
      Each sets forth her case, in dramatic antithesis. Pleasure is
      introduced as representing altogether the gratification of the
      corporeal appetites and the love of repose: while Virtue replies
      by saying, that if youth be employed altogether in pursuing such
      delights, at the time when the appetites are most vigorous &#8212; the
      result will be nothing but fatal disappointment, accompanied with
      entire loss of the different and superior pleasures available in
      mature years and in old age. Youth is the season of labour: the
      physical appetites must be indulged sparingly, and only at the
      call of actual want: accomplishments of body and mind must be
      acquired in that season, which will enable the mature man to
      perform in after life great and glorious exploits. He will thus
      realise the highest of all human delights &#8212; the love of his
      friends and the admiration of his countrymen &#8212; the sound of his
      own praises and the reflexion upon his own deserts. At the price
      of a youth passed in labour and self-denial, he will secure the
      fullest measure of mature and attainable happiness. </p>

    <p>&#8220;It is worth your while, Aristippus&#8221; (says Sokrates, in

      happen in the latter portions of your life.&#8221; </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_65"
          id="Sidenotev1_3_65"></a>Illustration afforded of the views of
        Sokrates respecting Good and Evil. </span></p>
    <p>This dialogue (one of the most interesting remnants of antiquity,
      and probably reported by Xenophon from actual hearing) is valuable
      in reference not only to Aristippus, but also to Sokrates himself.
      Many recent historians of philosophy describe Sokrates and Plato
      as setting up an idea of Virtue or Good Absolute (<i>i.e.</i> <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page178" id="v1page178"></a>178</span>having



      no essential reference to the happiness or security of the agent
      or of any one else) which they enforce &#8212; and an idea of Vice or
      Evil Absolute (<i>i.e.</i> having no essential reference to
      suffering or peril, or disappointment, either of the agent or of
      any one else) which they denounce and discommend and as thereby
      refuting the Sophists, who are said to have enforced Virtue and
      denounced Vice only relatively &#8212; <i>i.e.</i> in consequence of
      the bearing of one and the other upon the security and happiness
      of the agent or of others. Whether there be any one doctrine or
      style of preaching which can be fairly ascribed to the Sophists as
      a class, I will not again discuss here: but I believe that the
      most eminent among them, Protagoras and Prodikus, held the
      language here ascribed to them. But it is a mistake to suppose
      that upon this point Sokrates was their opponent. The Xenophontic
      Sokrates (a portrait more resembling reality than the Platonic)
      always holds this same language: the Platonic Sokrates not always,
      yet often. In the dialogue between Sokrates and Aristippus, as
      well as in the apologue of Prodikus, we see that the devotion of
      the season of youth to indulgence and inactive gratification of
      appetite, is blamed as productive of ruinous consequences &#8212; as
      entailing loss of future pleasures, together with a state of
      weakness which leaves no protection against future suffering;
      while great care is taken to show, that though laborious exercise
      is demanded during youth, such labour will be fully requited by
      the increased pleasures and happiness of after life. The pleasure
      of being praised, and the pleasure of seeing good deeds performed
      by one&#8217;s self, are especially insisted on. On this point both
      Sokrates and Prodikus concur.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_155"

          id="Sidenotev1_3_66"></a>Comparison of the Xenophontic
        Sokrates with the Platonic Sokrates. </span></p>
    <p>If again we compare the Xenophontic Sokrates with the Platonic
      Sokrates, we shall find that the lecture of the former to
      Aristippus coincides sufficiently with the theory laid down by the
      latter in the dialogue Protagoras; to which theory the Sophist
      Protagoras is represented as yielding a reluctant adhesion. But we
      shall find also that it differs materially from the doctrine
      maintained <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page179"
          id="v1page179"></a>179</span>by Sokrates in the Platonic
      Gorgias. Nay, if we follow the argument addressed by the
      Xenophontic Sokrates to Aristippus, we perceive that it is in
      substance similar to that which the Platonic dialogue Gorgias puts
      in the mouth of the rhetor P&ocirc;lus and the politician
      Kallikl&ecirc;s. The Xenophontic Sokrates distributes men into two
      classes &#8212; the rulers and the ruled: the former strong, well-armed,
      and well-trained, who enjoy life at the expense of the submission
      and suffering of the latter: the former committing injustice, the
      latter enduring injustice. He impresses upon Aristippus the misery
      of being confounded with the suffering many, and exhorts him to
      qualify himself by a laborious apprenticeship for enrolment among
      the ruling few. If we read the Platonic Gorgias, we shall see that
      this is the same strain in which P&ocirc;lus and Kallikl&ecirc;s
      address Sokrates, when they invite him to exchange philosophy for
      rhetoric, and to qualify himself for active political life.
      &#8220;Unless you acquire these accomplishments, you will be helpless
      and defenceless against injury and insult from others: while, if
      you acquire them, you will raise yourself to political influence,
      and will exercise power over others, thus obtaining the fullest
      measure of enjoyment which life affords: see the splendid position
      to which the Macedonian usurper Archelaus has recently exalted
      himself.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_156" href="#Footnotev1_3_156"><span
          class="sp">156</span></a> Philosophy is useful, when studied
      in youth for a short time as preface to professional and political
      apprenticeship: but if a man perseveres in it and makes it the
      occupation of life, he will not only be useless to others, but
      unable to protect himself; he will be exposed to suffer any
      injustice which the well-trained and powerful men may put upon
      him.&#8221; To these exhortations of P&ocirc;lus and Kallikl&ecirc;s
      Sokrates replies by admitting their case as true matter of fact.
      &#8220;I know that I am exposed to such insults and injuries: but my
      life is just and innocent. If I suffer, I shall suffer wrong: and
      those who do the wrong will thereby inflict upon themselves a
      greater mischief than they inflict upon me. Doing wrong is worse
      for the agent than suffering wrong.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_157"

    <p>There is indeed this difference between the Xenophontic <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page180" id="v1page180"></a>180</span>Sokrates



      in his address to Aristippus, and the Platonic Kallikl&ecirc;s in
      his exhortation to Sokrates: That whereas Kallikl&ecirc;s
      proclaims and even vindicates it as natural justice and right,
      that the strong should gratify their desires by oppressing and
      despoiling the weak &#8212; the Xenophontic Sokrates merely asserts such
      oppression as an actual fact, notorious and undeniable,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_158" href="#Footnotev1_3_158"><span
          class="sp">158</span></a> without either approving or blaming
      it. Plato, constructing an imaginary conversation with the purpose
      that Sokrates shall be victorious, contrives intentionally and
      with dramatic consistency that the argument of Kallikl&ecirc;s
      shall be advanced in terms so invidious and revolting that no one
      else would be bold enough to speak it out:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_159" href="#Footnotev1_3_159"><span
          class="sp">159</span></a> which contrivance was the more
      necessary, as Sokrates is made not only to disparage the poets,
      rhetors, and most illustrious statesmen of historical Athens, but
      to sustain a thesis in which he admits himself to stand alone,
      opposed to aristocrats as well as democrats.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_160" href="#Footnotev1_3_160"><span
          class="sp">160</span></a> Yet though there is this material
      difference in the manner of handling, the plan of life which the
      Xenophontic Sokrates urges upon Aristippus, and the grounds upon
      which he enforces it, are really the same as those which
      Kallikl&ecirc;s in the Platonic Gorgias urges upon Sokrates.
      &#8220;Labour to qualify yourself for active political power&#8221; &#8212; is the
      lesson addressed in the one case to a wealthy man who passed his
      life in ease and indulgence, in the other case to a poor man who
      devoted himself to speculative debate on general questions, and to
      cross-examination of every one who would listen and answer. The
      man of indulgence, and the man of speculation,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_161" href="#Footnotev1_3_161"><span
          class="sp">161</span></a> were both of them equally destitute
      of those active energies <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page181" id="v1page181"></a>181</span>which were
      necessary to confer power over others, or even security against
      oppression by others. </p>

        If we read the conversation alleged by Thucydides (v.
        94-105-112) to have taken place between the Athenian generals
        and the executive council of Melos, just before the siege of
        that island by the Athenians, we shall see that this same
        language is held by the Athenians. &#8220;You, the Melians, being much
        weaker, must submit to us who are much stronger; this is the
        universal law and necessity of nature, which we are not the
        first to introduce, but only follow out, as others have done
        before us, and will do after us. Submit &#8212; or it will be worse

        If we read the treatise of Plutarch, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#931;&#964;&#969;&#943;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;
        (c. 2-3, p. 1033 C-D), we shall see that the Stoic writers,
        Zeno, Kleanthes, Chrysippus, Diogenes, Antipater, all of them
        earnestly recommended a life of active citizenship and laborious
        political duty, as incumbent upon philosophers not less than
        upon others; and that they treated with contempt a life of
        literary leisure and speculation. Chrysippus explicitly declared
        &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#963;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166; <i>i. e.</i>
        that the speculative philosopher who kept aloof from political
        activity, was in substance a follower of Epikurus. Tacitus holds
        much the same language (Hist. iv. 5) when he says about
        Helvidius Priscus:&#8212;&#8220;ingenium illustre altioribus studiis juvenis
        admodum dedit: non, ut plerique, ut nomine magnifico segne otium
        velaret, sed quo constantior adversus fortuita rempublicam
        capesseret,&#8221; &amp;c. </p>
      <p>The contradiction which Plutarch notes is, that these very
        Stoic philosophers (Chrysippus and the others) who affected to
        despise all modes of life except active civic duty &#8212; were
        themselves, all, men of literary leisure, spending their lives
        away from their native cities, in writing and talking
        philosophy. The same might have been said about Sokrates and
        Plato (except as to leaving their native cities), both of whom
        incurred the same reproach for inactivity as Sokrates here
        addresses to Aristippus.</p>
    </div>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_68"
          id="Sidenotev1_3_68"></a>Language held by Aristippus &#8212; his
        scheme of life.</span> </p>
    <p>In the Xenophontic dialogue, Aristippus replies to Sokrates that
      the apprenticeship enjoined upon him is too laborious, and that
      the exercise of power, itself laborious, has no charm for him. He
      desires a middle course, neither to oppress nor to be oppressed:
      neither to command, nor to be commanded &#8212; like Otanes among the
      seven Persian conspirators.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_162"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_162"><span class="sp">162</span></a> He
      keeps clear of political obligation, and seeks to follow, as much
      as he can, his own individual judgment. Though Sokrates, in the
      Xenophontic dialogue, is made to declare this middle course
      impossible, yet it is substantially the same as what the Platonic
      Sokrates in the Gorgias aspires to:&#8212;moreover the same as what the
      real Sokrates at Athens both pursued as far as he could, and
      declared to be the only course consistent with his security.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_163" href="#Footnotev1_3_163"><span
          class="sp">163</span></a> The Platonic Sokrates in the Gorgias
      declares emphatically that no man can hope to take active part in
      the government of a country, unless he be heartily identified in
      spirit with the ethical and political system of the country:
      unless he not merely professes, but actually and sincerely shares,
      the creed, doctrines, tastes, and modes of appreciation prevalent
      among the citizens.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_164"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_164"><span class="sp">164</span></a> Whoever
      is deficient in this indispensable condition, must be content &#8220;to
      mind his own business and to abstain from active meddling with
      public affairs&#8221;. This is the course which the Platonic Sokrates
      claims both for <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page182"
          id="v1page182"></a>182</span>himself and for the philosopher
      generally:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_165" href="#Footnotev1_3_165"><span
          class="sp">165</span></a> it is also the course which
      Aristippus chooses for himself, under the different title of a
      middle way between the extortion of the ruler and the suffering of
      the subordinate. And the argument of Sokrates that no middle way
      is possible &#8212; far from refuting Aristippus (as Xenophon says that
      it did)<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_166" href="#Footnotev1_3_166"><span

        invitation as the Xenophontic Sokrates addresses to Aristippus.
        Again, in Plat. Republ. viii. pp. 549 C, 550 A, we read, that
        corruption of the virtuous character begins by invitations to
        the shy youth to depart from the quiet plan of life followed by
        a virtuous father (who is &#964;&#8048; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#949;&#953;) and to enter on a
        career of active political ambition. The youth is induced, by
        instigation of his mother and relatives without, to pass from
        &#7936;&#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#951; to &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#951;, which is described as a change
        for the worse. Even in Xenophon (Memor. iii. 11, 16) Sokrates
        recognises and jests upon his own &#7936;&#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#951;.</p>

        Xen. Mem. iii. 8, 1. Diogenes L. says (and it is probable
        enough, from radical difference of character) that Xenophon was
        adversely disposed to Aristippus. In respect to other persons
        also, Xenophon puts invidious constructions (for which at any
        rate no ground is shown) upon their purposes in questioning
        Sokrates: thus, in the dialogue (i. 6) with the Sophist
        Antiphon, he says that Antiphon questioned Sokrates in order to
        seduce him away from his companions (Mem. i. 6, 1).</p>

        Sokrates, according to the character of the hearer. </span></p>
    <p>The real Sokrates, since he talked incessantly and with every
      one, must of course have known how to diversify his conversation
      and adapt it to each listener. Xenophon not only attests this
      generally,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_167" href="#Footnotev1_3_167"><span
          class="sp">167</span></a> but has preserved the proofs of it
      in his Memorabilia &#8212; real conversations, reported though doubtless
      dressed up by himself. The conversations which he has preserved
      relate chiefly to piety and to the duties and proceedings of
      active life: and to the necessity of controuling the appetites:
      these he selected partly because they suited his proclaimed
      purpose of replying to the topics of indictment, partly because
      they were in harmony with his own <i>id&eacute;al</i>. Xenophon
      was a man of action, resolute in mind and vigorous in body,
      performing with credit the duties of the general as well as of the
      soldier. His heroes were men like Cyrus, Agesilaus, Ischomachus &#8212;
      warriors, horsemen, hunters, husbandmen, always engaged in active
      competition for power, glory, or profit, and never shrinking from
      danger, fatigue, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page183"
          id="v1page183"></a>183</span>or privation. For a life of easy
      and unambitious indulgence, even though accompanied by mental and
      speculative activity &#8212; &#8220;homines ignav&acirc; oper&acirc; et
      philosophi&acirc; sententi&acirc;&#8221; &#8212; he had no respect. It was on
      this side that the character of Aristippus certainly seemed to be,
      and probably really was, the most defective. Sokrates employed the
      arguments the most likely to call forth within him habits of
      action &#8212; to render him &#960;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_168"

      diffident Charmides,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_169"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_169"><span class="sp">169</span></a>
      Sokrates used language adapted to correct the respective
      infirmities of each. In addressing Kritias and Alkibiades, he
      would consider it necessary not only to inculcate self-denial as
      to appetite, but to repress an exorbitance of ambition.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_170" href="#Footnotev1_3_170"><span
          class="sp">170</span></a> But in dealing with Aristippus,
      while insisting upon command of appetite and acquirement of active
      energy, he at the same time endeavours to kindle ambition, and the
      love of command: he even goes so far as to deny the possibility of
      a middle course, and to maintain (what Kritias and Alkibiades<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_171" href="#Footnotev1_3_171"><span
          class="sp">171</span></a> would have cordially approved) that
      there was no alternative open, except between the position of the
      oppressive governors and that of the suffering subjects. Addressed
      to Aristippus, these topics were likely to thrust forcibly upon
      his attention the danger of continued indulgences during the
      earlier years of life, and the necessity, in view to his own
      future security, for training in habits of vigour, courage,
      self-command, endurance. </p>

        We see from the first two chapters of the Memorabilia of
        Xenophon (as well as from the subsequent intimation of
        &AElig;schines, in the oration against Timarchus, p. 173) how
        much stress was laid by the accusers of Sokrates on the fact
        that he had educated Kritias and Alkibiades; and how the
        accusers alleged that his teaching tended to encourage the like
        exorbitant aspirations in others, dangerous to established
        authority, traditional, legal, parental, divine. I do not doubt
        (what Xenophon affirms) that Sokrates, when he conversed with
        Kritias and Alkibiades, held a very opposite language. But it
        was otherwise when he talked with men of ease and indulgence
        without ambition, such as Aristippus. If Mel&ecirc;tus and
        Anytus could have put in evidence the conversation of Sokrates
        with Aristippus, many points of it would have strengthened their
        case against Sokrates before the Dikasts. We read in Xenophon
        (Mem. i. 2, 58) how the point was made to tell, that Sokrates
        often cited and commented on the passage of the Iliad (ii. 188)
        in which the Grecian chiefs, retiring from the agora to their
        ships, are described as being respectfully addressed by Odysseus
        &#8212; while the common soldiers are scolded and beaten by him, for
        the very same conduct: the relation which Sokrates here dwells
        on as subsisting between &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; and &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;, would
        favour the like colouring.</p>

    <p>Xenophon notices briefly two other colloquies between Sokrates
      and Aristippus. The latter asked Sokrates, &#8220;Do you know anything
      good?&#8221; in order (says Xenophon) that if Sokrates answered in the
      affirmative and gave as examples, health, wealth, strength,
      courage, bread, &amp;c., he (Aristippus) might show circumstances
      in which this same particular was evil; and might thus catch
      Sokrates in a contradiction, as Sokrates had caught him before.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_172" href="#Footnotev1_3_172"><span
          class="sp">172</span></a> But Sokrates (says Xenophon) far
      from seeking to fence with the question, retorted it in such a way
      as to baffle the questioner, and at the same time to improve and
      instruct the by-standers.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_173"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_173"><span class="sp">173</span></a> &#8220;Do you

      mean to ask me, whether I know anything good, which is good for
      nothing &#8212; I reply that I neither know any such thing, nor care to
      know it.&#8221; </p>

        Xenoph. Memor. iii. 8, 1. Both Xenophon and some of his
        commentators censure this as a captious string of questions put
        by Aristippus &#8212; &#8220;captiosas Aristippi qu&aelig;stiunculas&#8221;. Such
        a criticism is preposterous, when we recollect that Sokrates was
        continually examining and questioning others in the same manner.
        See in particular his cross-examination of Euthyd&ecirc;mus,
        reported by Xenophon, Memor. iv. 2; and many others like it,

    <p>Again, on another occasion Aristippus asked him &#8220;Do you know
      anything beautiful? &#8212; Yes; many things. &#8212; Are they all like to
      each other? &#8212; No; they are as unlike as possible to each other. &#8212;
      How then (continues Aristippus) can that which is unlike to the
      beautiful, be itself beautiful? &#8212; Easily enough (replies
      Sokrates); one man is beautiful for running; another man,
      altogether unlike him, is beautiful for wrestling. A shield which
      is beautiful for protecting your body, is altogether unlike to a
      javelin, which is beautiful for being swiftly and forcibly hurled.
      &#8212; Your answer (rejoined Aristippus) is exactly the same as it was
      when I asked you whether you knew anything good. &#8212; Certainly
      (replies Sokrates). Do you imagine, that the Good is one thing,
      and the Beautiful another? Do you not know that all things are
      good and beautiful in relation to the same purpose? Virtue is not
      good in relation to one purpose, and beautiful in relation to
      another. Men are called both good and beautiful in reference to
      the same ends: the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page185"
          id="v1page185"></a>185</span>bodies of men, in like manner:
      and all things which men use, are considered both good and
      beautiful, in consideration of their serving their ends well. &#8212;
      Then (says Aristippus) a basket for carrying dung is beautiful? &#8212;
      To be sure (replied Sokrates), and a golden shield is ugly; if the
      former be well made for doing its work, and the latter badly. &#8212; Do
      you then assert (asked Aristippus) that the same things are
      beautiful and ugly? &#8212; Assuredly (replied Sokrates); and the same
      things are both good and evil. That which is good for hunger, is
      often bad for a fever: that which is good for a fever, is often
      bad for hunger. What is beautiful for running is often ugly for
      wrestling &#8212; and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. All things are good and
      beautiful, in relation to the ends which they serve well: all
      things are evil and ugly, in relation to the ends which they serve

        of Good. </span></p>
    <p>These last cited colloquies also, between Sokrates and
      Aristippus, are among the most memorable remains of Grecian
      philosophy: belonging to one of the years preceding 399 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, in which last year Sokrates perished.
      Here (as in the former dialogue) the doctrine is distinctly
      enunciated by Sokrates &#8212; That Good and Evil &#8212; Beautiful (or
      Honourable) and Ugly (or Dishonourable &#8212; Base) &#8212; have no
      intelligible meaning except in relation to human happiness and
      security. Good or Evil Absolute (<i>i.e.</i>, apart from such
      relation) is denied to exist. The theory of Absolute Good (a
      theory traceable to the Parmenidean doctrines, and adopted from
      them by Eukleides) becomes first known to us as elaborated by
      Plato. Even in his dialogues it is neither always nor exclusively
      advocated, but is often modified by, and sometimes even exchanged
      for, the eud&aelig;monistic or relative theory. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_72"
          id="Sidenotev1_3_72"></a> Good is relative to human beings and
        wants, in the view of Sokrates. </span></p>
    <p>Sokrates declares very explicitly, in his conversation with
      Aristippus, what <i>he</i> means by the Good and the Beautiful:
      and when therefore in the name of the Good and the Beautiful, he
      protests against an uncontrolled devotion to the pleasures of
      sense (as in one of the Xenophontic dialogues with Euthydemus<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_175" href="#Footnotev1_3_175"><span
          class="sp">175</span></a>), what he <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page186" id="v1page186"></a>186</span>means is, that a
      man by such intemperance ruins his prospects of future happiness,
      and his best means of being useful both to himself and others.
      Whether Aristippus first learnt from Sokrates the relative theory
      of the Good and the Beautiful, or had already embraced it before,
      we cannot say. Some of his questions, as reported in Xenophon,
      would lead us to suspect that it took him by surprise: just as we
      find, in the Protagoras of Plato that a theory substantially the
      same, though in different words, is proposed by the Platonic
      Sokrates to the Sophist Protagoras: who at first repudiates it,
      but is compelled ultimately to admit it by the elaborate dialectic
      of Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_176" href="#Footnotev1_3_176"><span
          class="sp">176</span></a> If Aristippus did not learn the
      theory from Sokrates, he was at any rate fortified in it by the
      authority of Sokrates; to whose doctrine, in this respect, he
      adhered more closely than Plato.</p>

        Xenoph. Memor. iv. 5. </p>
      <p>Sokrates exhorts those with whom he converses to be sparing in
        indulgences, and to cultivate self-command and fortitude as well
        as bodily energy and activity. The reason upon which these
        exhortations are founded is eud&aelig;monistic: that a person
        will thereby escape or be able to confront serious dangers &#8212; and
        will obtain for himself ultimately greater pleasures than those
        which he foregoes (Memor. i. 6, 8; ii. 1, 31-33; iii. 12, 2-5).

        See also Memor. ii. 4, ii. 10, 4, about the importance of
        acquiring and cultivating friends, because a good friend is the
        most useful and valuable of all possessions. Sokrates, like
        Aristippus, adopts the prudential view of life, and not the
        transcendental; recommending sobriety and virtue on the ground
        of pleasures secured and pains averted. We find Plutarch, in his
        very bitter attacks on Epikurus, reasoning on the Hedonistic
        basis, and professing to prove that Epikurus discarded pleasures
        more and greater for the sake of obtaining pleasures fewer and
        less. See Plutarch, Non posse suaviter vivi secundum Epicurum,
        pp. 1096-1099.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_3_74"></a>Life and dicta of Aristippus &#8212; His
        type of character.</span> </p>
    <p>In estimating the character of Aristippus, I have brought into
      particular notice the dialogues reported by Xenophon, because the
      Xenophontic statements, with those of Aristotle, are the only
      contemporary evidence (for Plato only names him once to say that
      he was not present at the death of Sokrates, and was reported to
      be in &AElig;gina). The other statements respecting Aristippus,
      preserved <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page187"
          id="v1page187"></a>187</span>by Diogenes and others, not only
      come from later authorities, but give us hardly any facts; though
      they ascribe to him a great many sayings and repartees, adapted to
      a peculiar type of character. That type of character, together
      with an imperfect notion of his doctrines, is all that we can make
      out. Though Aristippus did not follow the recommendation of
      Sokrates, to labour and qualify himself for a ruler, yet both the
      advice of Sokrates, to reflect and prepare himself for the
      anxieties and perils of the future &#8212; and the spectacle of
      self-sufficing independence which the character of Sokrates
      afforded &#8212; were probably highly useful to him. Such advice being
      adverse to the natural tendencies of his mind, impressed upon him
      forcibly those points of the case which he was most likely to
      forget: and contributed to form in him that habit of self-command
      which is a marked feature in his character. He wished (such are
      the words ascribed to him by Xenophon) to pass through life as
      easily and agreeably as possible. Ease comes before pleasure: but
      his plan of life was to obtain as much pleasure as he could,
      consistent with ease, or without difficulty and danger. He
      actually realised, as far as our means of knowledge extend, that
      middle path of life which Sokrates declared to be impracticable. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_75"
          id="Sidenotev1_3_75"></a>Aristippus acted conformably to the
        advice of Sokrates.</span> </p>
    <p>Much of the advice given by Sokrates, Aristippus appears to have
      followed, though not from the reasons which Sokrates puts forward
      for giving it. When Sokrates reminds him that men liable to be
      tempted and ensnared by the love of good eating, were unfit to
      command &#8212; when he animadverts on the insanity of the passionate
      lover, who exposed himself to the extremity of danger for the
      purpose of possessing a married woman, while there were such
      abundant means of gratifying the sexual appetite without any
      difficulty or danger whatever<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_179"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_179"><span class="sp">179</span></a> &#8212; to
      all this Aristippus assents: and what we read about his life is in
      perfect conformity therewith. Reason and prudence supply ample
      motives for following such advice, whether a man be animated with
      the love of command or not. So again, when Sokrates impresses upon
      Aristippus that <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page188"
          id="v1page188"></a>188</span>the Good and the Beautiful were
      the same, being relative only to human wants or satisfaction &#8212; and
      that nothing was either good or beautiful, except in so far as it
      tended to confer relief, security, or enjoyment &#8212; this lesson too
      Aristippus laid to heart, and applied in a way suitable to his own
      peculiar dispositions and capacities. </p>

        great aspiration of Aristippus. </span></p>
    <p>The type of character represented by Aristippus is the man who
      enjoys what the present affords, so far as can be done without
      incurring future mischief, or provoking the enmity of others &#8212; but
      who will on no account enslave himself to any enjoyment; who
      always maintains his own self-mastery and independence and who has
      prudence and intelligence enabling him to regulate each separate
      enjoyment so as not to incur preponderant evil in future.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_180" href="#Footnotev1_3_180"><span
          class="sp">180</span></a> This self-mastery and independence
      is in point of fact the capital aspiration of Aristippus, hardly
      less than of Antisthenes and Diogenes. He is competent to deal
      suitably with all varieties of persons, places, and situations,
      and to make the best of each &#8212; &#927;&#8023; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#8150;, &#964;&#959;&#965;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7990;&#956;&#8217;

          class="sp">181</span></a> but he accepts what the situation
      presents, without yearning or struggling for that which it cannot
      present.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_182" href="#Footnotev1_3_182"><span
          class="sp">182</span></a> He enjoys the society both of the
      Syracusan despot Dionysius, and of the Het&aelig;ra Lais; but he
      will not make himself subservient either to one or to the other:
      he conceives himself able to afford, to both, as much satisfaction
      as he receives.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_183" href="#Footnotev1_3_183"><span
          class="sp">183</span></a> His enjoyments are not enhanced by
      the idea that others are excluded from the like enjoyment, and
      that he is a superior, privileged man: he has no jealousy or
      antipathy, no passion for triumphing over rivals, no demand for
      envy or admiration from spectators. Among the Het&aelig;r&aelig;
      in Greece were included all the most engaging and accomplished
      women &#8212; for in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page189"
          id="v1page189"></a>189</span>Grecian matrimony, it was
      considered becoming and advantageous that the bride should be
      young and ignorant, and that as a wife she should neither see nor
      know any thing beyond the administration of her own feminine
      apartments and household.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_184"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_184"><span class="sp">184</span></a>
      Aristippus attached himself to those Het&aelig;r&aelig; who
      pleased him; declaring that the charm of their society was in no
      way lessened by the knowledge that others enjoyed it also, and
      that he could claim no exclusive privilege.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_185" href="#Footnotev1_3_185"><span
          class="sp">185</span></a> His patience and mildness in
      argument is much commended. The main lesson which he had learnt
      from philosophy (he said), was self-appreciation &#8212; to behave
      himself with confidence in every man&#8217;s society: even if all laws
      were abrogated, the philosopher would still, without any law, live
      in the same way as he now did.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_186"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_186"><span class="sp">186</span></a> His
      confidence remained unshaken, when seized as a captive in Asia by

      easily attainable, nor to accumulate wealth or power which did not
      yield positive result.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_188"

      forget all reason and duty &#8212; Aristippus has sufficient
      self-mastery to visit the most seductive Het&aelig;r&aelig;

        Diogenes, and of the Stoics Zeno and Chrysippus (D. L. vii.
        131), who maintained, that among the wise wives ought to be in
        common, and that all marital jealousy ought to be discarded.

      <p>That the society of these fascinating Het&aelig;r&aelig; was

    <p>We can understand and compare the different types of character
      represented by Antisthenes or Diogenes, and by Aristippus: but we
      have little knowledge of the real facts of their lives. The two
      types, each manifesting that marked individuality which belongs to
      the Sokratic band, though in many respects strongly contrasted,
      have also some points of agreement. Both Aristippus and Diogenes
      are bent on individual freedom and independence of character: both
      of them stand upon their own appreciation of life and its
      phenomena: both of them are impatient of that servitude to the
      opinions and antipathies of <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page191" id="v1page191"></a>191</span>others, which
      induces a man to struggle for objects, not because they afford him
      satisfaction, but because others envy him for possessing them &#8212;
      and to keep off evils, not because he himself feels them as such,
      but because others pity or despise him for being subject to them;
      both of them are exempt from the competitive and ambitious
      feelings, from the thirst after privilege and power, from the
      sense of superiority arising out of monopolised possession and
      exclusion of others from partnership. Diogenes kept aloof from
      political life and civil obligations as much as Aristippus; and
      would have pronounced (as Aristippus replies to Sokrates in the
      Xenophontic dialogue) that the task of ruling others, instead of
      being a prize to be coveted, was nothing better than an onerous
      and mortifying servitude,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_193"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_193"><span class="sp">193</span></a> not at
      all less onerous because a man took up the burthen of his own
      accord. These points of agreement are real: but the points of
      disagreement are not less real. Diogenes maintains his free
      individuality, and puts himself out of the reach of human enmity,
      by clothing himself in impenetrable armour: by attaining positive
      insensibility, as near as human life permits. This is with him not
      merely the acting out of a scheme of life, but also a matter of
      pride. He is proud of his ragged garment and coarse<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_194" href="#Footnotev1_3_194"><span
          class="sp">194</span></a> fare, as exalting him above others,
      and as constituting him a pattern of endurance: and he indulges
      this sentiment by stinging and contemptuous censure of every one.
      Aristippus has no similar vanity: he achieves his independence
      without so heavy a renunciation: he follows out his own plan of
      life, without setting himself up as a pattern for others. But his
      plan is at the same time more delicate; requiring greater skill
      and intelligence, more of <span class="pagenum"><a

      sagacity, in the performer. Horace, who compares the two and gives
      the preference to Aristippus, remarks that Diogenes, though
      professing to want nothing, was nevertheless as much dependent
      upon the bounty of those who supplied his wallet with provisions,
      as Aristippus upon the favour of princes: and that Diogenes had
      only one fixed mode of proceeding, while Aristippus could master
      and turn to account a great diversity of persons and situations &#8212;
      could endure hardship with patience and dignity, when it was
      inevitable, and enjoy the opportunities of pleasure when they
      occurred. &#8220;To Aristippus alone it is given to wear both fine

        It is this servitude of political life, making the politician
        the slave of persons and circumstances around him, which Horace
        contrasts with the philosophical independence of Aristippus:&#8212; </p>

      <p>Horace&#8217;s view and scheme of life are exceedingly analogous to

        Straton, who was not contemporary with Aristippus. Even Sokrates
        lived by the bounty of his rich friends, and indeed could have
        had no other means of supporting his wife and children; though
        he accepted only a portion of what they tendered to him,
        declining the remainder. See the remark of Aristippus, Diog. L.

    <p>That the scheme of life projected by Aristippus was very
      difficult requiring great dexterity, prudence, and resolution, to
      execute it &#8212; we may see plainly by the Xenophontic dialogue;
      wherein Sokrates pronounces it to be all but impracticable. As far
      as we can judge, he surmounted the difficulties of it: yet we do
      not know enough of his real life to determine with accuracy what
      varieties of difficulties he experienced. He <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page193" id="v1page193"></a>193</span>followed



      the profession of a Sophist, receiving fees for his teaching: and
      his attachment to philosophy (both as contrasted with ignorance
      and as contrasted with other studies not philosophy) was
      proclaimed in the most emphatic language. It was better (he said)
      to be a beggar, than an uneducated man:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_197"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_197"><span class="sp">197</span></a> the
      former was destitute of money, but the latter was destitute of
      humanity. He disapproved varied and indiscriminate instruction,
      maintaining that persons ought to learn in youth what they were to
      practise in manhood: and he compared those who, neglecting
      philosophy, employed themselves in literature or physical science,
      to the suitors in the Odyssey who obtained the favours of Melantho
      and the other female servants, but were rejected by the Queen
      Penelop&ecirc; herself.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_198"

      treated with contempt the study of geometry, because it took no
      account, and made no mention, of what was good and evil, beautiful
      and ugly. In other arts (he said), even in the vulgar proceeding
      of the carpenter and the currier, perpetual reference was made to
      good, as the purpose intended to be served and to evil as that
      which was to be avoided: but in geometry no such purpose was ever

        reputation thus acquired procured for him the attentions of
        Dionysius and others. </span></p>
    <p>This last opinion of Aristippus deserves particular attention,
      because it is attested by Aristotle. And it confirms what we hear
      upon less certain testimony, that Aristippus discountenanced the
      department of physical study generally (astronomy and physics) as
      well as geometry; confining his attention to facts and reasonings
      which bore upon the regulation of life.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_200"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_200"><span class="sp">200</span></a> In this
      restrictive view he followed the example and precepts of Sokrates
      &#8212; of Isokrates &#8212; seemingly also of Protagoras and Prodikus though
      not of the Eleian Hippias, whose course of study was larger and
      more varied.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_201" href="#Footnotev1_3_201"><span
          class="sp">201</span></a> Aristippus taught as a Sophist, and
      appears to have acquired great reputation <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page194" id="v1page194"></a>194</span>in that capacity
      both at Athens and elsewhere.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_202"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_202"><span class="sp">202</span></a> Indeed,
      if he had not acquired such intellectual and literary reputation
      at Athens, he would have had little chance of being invited
      elsewhere, and still less chance of receiving favours and presents
      from Dionysius and other princes:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_203"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_203"><span class="sp">203</span></a> whose
      attentions did not confer celebrity, but waited upon it when
      obtained, and doubtless augmented it. If Aristippus lived a life
      of indulgence at Athens, we may fairly presume that his main
      resources for sustaining it, like those of Isokrates, were derived
      from his own teaching: and that the presents which he received
      from Dionysius of Syracuse, like those which Isokrates received
      from Nikokles of Cyprus, were welcome additions, but not his main
      income. Those who (like most of the historians of philosophy)
      adopt the opinion of Sokrates and Plato, that it is disgraceful
      for an instructor to receive payment from the persons taught will
      doubtless despise Aristippus for such a proceeding: for my part I
      dissent from this opinion, and I therefore do not concur in the
      disparaging epithets bestowed upon him. And as for the costly
      indulgences, and subservience to foreign princes, of which
      Aristippus stands accused, we must recollect that the very same <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page195" id="v1page195"></a>195</span>reproaches



      were advanced against Plato and Aristotle by their contemporaries:
      and as far as we know, with quite as much foundation.<a

        Several anecdotes are recounted about sayings and doings of
        Aristippus in his intercourse with <i>Dionysius</i>. <i>Which</i>
        Dionysius is meant? &#8212; the elder or the younger? Probably the
        elder. </p>
      <p>It is to be remembered that Dionysius the Elder lived and
        reigned until the year 367 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, in
        which year his son Dionysius the Younger succeeded him. The
        death of Sokrates took place in 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>:
        between which, and the accession of Dionysius the Younger, an
        interval of 32 years occurred. Plato was old, being sixty years
        of age, when he first visited the younger Dionysius, shortly
        after the accession of the latter. Aristippus cannot well have
        been younger than Plato, and he is said to have been older than
        &AElig;schines Sokraticus (D. L. ii. 83). Compare D. L. ii. 41.
      </p>
      <p>When, with these dates present to our minds, we read the
        anecdotes recounted by Diogenes L. respecting the sayings and
        doings of Aristippus with <i>Dionysius</i>, we find: that
        several of them relate to the contrast between the behaviour of
        Aristippus and that of Plato at Syracuse. Now it is certain that
        Plato went <i>once</i> to Syracuse when he was forty years of
        age (Epist. vii. init.), in 387 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        &#8212; and according to one report (Lucian, De Parasito, 34), he went
        there <i>twice</i> &#8212; while the elder Dionysius was in the
        plenitude of power: but he made an unfavourable impression, and
        was speedily sent away in displeasure. I think it very probable
        that Aristippus may have visited the elder Dionysius, and may
        have found greater favour with him than Plato found (see Lucian,
        l. c.), since Dionysius was an accomplished man and a composer
        of tragedies. Moreover Aristippus was a Kyren&aelig;an, and
        Aristippus wrote about Libya (D. L. ii. 83).</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_3_80"></a>Ethical theory of Aristippus and the
        Kyrenaic philosophers.</span> </p>
    <p>As all the works of Aristippus are lost, we cannot pretend to
      understand fully his theory from the meagre abstract given in
      Sextus Empiricus and Diogenes. Yet the theory is of importance in
      the history of ancient speculation, since it passed with some
      modifications to Epikurus, and was adopted by a large proportion
      of instructed men. The Kyrenaic doctrine was transmitted by
      Aristippus to his disciples &AElig;thiops and Antipater: but his
      chief disciple appears to have been his daughter
      Ar&ecirc;t&ecirc;: whom he instructed so well, that she was able
      to instruct her own son, the second Aristippus, called for that
      reason Metrodidactus. The basis of his ethical theory was,
      pleasure and pain: pleasure being <i>smooth motion</i>, pain, <i>rough



        motion</i>:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_206" href="#Footnotev1_3_206"><span
          class="sp">206</span></a> pleasure being the object which all
      animals, by nature and without deliberation, loved, pursued, and
      felt satisfaction in obtaining pain being the object which they
      all by nature hated and tried to avoid. Aristippus considered that
      no one pleasure was different from another, nor more pleasurable
      than another:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_207" href="#Footnotev1_3_207"><span
          class="sp">207</span></a> that the attainment of these special
      pleasurable moments, or as many of them as practicable, was The
      End to be pursued in life. By <i>Happiness</i>, they understood
      the sum total of these special pleasures, past, present, and
      future: yet Happiness was desirable <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page196" id="v1page196"></a>196</span>not on its own
      account, but on account of its constituent items, especially such
      of those items as were present and certainly future.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_208" href="#Footnotev1_3_208"><span
          class="sp">208</span></a> Pleasures and pains of memory and
      expectation were considered to be of little importance. Absence of
      pain or relief from pain, on the one hand &#8212; they did not consider
      as equivalent to positive pleasure &#8212; nor absence of pleasure or
      withdrawal of pleasure, on the other hand &#8212; as equivalent to
      positive pain. Neither the one situation nor the other was a <i>motion</i>
      (&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;), <i>i.e.</i> a positive situation, appreciable by the
      consciousness: each was a middle state &#8212; a mere negation of
      consciousness, like the phenomena of sleep.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_209" href="#Footnotev1_3_209"><span
          class="sp">209</span></a> They recognised some mental
      pleasures and pains as derivative from bodily sensation and as
      exclusively individual &#8212; others as not so: for example, there were
      pleasures and pains of sympathy; and a man often felt joy at the
      prosperity of his friends and countrymen, quite as genuine as that
      which he felt for his own good fortune. But they maintained that
      the bodily pleasures and pains were much more vehement than the
      mental which were not bodily: for which reason, the pains employed
      by the laws in punishing offenders were chiefly bodily. The fear
      of pain was in their judgments more operative than the love of
      pleasure: and though pleasure was desirable for its own sake, yet
      the accompanying conditions of many pleasures were so painful as
      to deter the prudent man from aiming at them. These obstructions
      rendered it impossible for any one to realise the sum total of
      pleasures constituting Happiness. Even the wise man sometimes
      failed, and the foolish man sometimes did well, though in general
      the reverse was the truth: but under the difficult conditions of
      life, a man must be satisfied if he realised some particular
      pleasurable conjunctions, without aspiring to a continuance or
      totality of the like.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_210"

        or that one pain is more vehement and deterrent than another
        pain: for it is expressly said afterwards (s. 90) that they
        admitted this. They meant to affirm that one pleasure did not
        differ from another <i>so far forth as pleasure</i>: that all
        pleasures must be ranked as a class, and compared with each
        other in respect of intensity, durability, and other properties

      <p>A doctrine very different from this is ascribed to Aristippus

        affirmed that by pleasure Aristippus understood, not the
        pleasure of sense, but that disposition of mind whereby a person
        becomes insensible to pain, and hard to be imposed upon
        (&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#955;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#965;&#963;&#947;&#959;&#942;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#962;).</p>

      <p>It does not appear that the Kyrenaic sect followed out into
        detail the derivative pleasures and pains; nor the way in which,
        by force of association, these come to take precedence of the
        primary, exercising influence on the mind both more forcible and
        more constant. We find this important fact remarkably stated in
        the doctrine of Kalliphon. </p>

      procure and the pains which it enabled us to avoid &#8212; and wealth as

      use and necessities of life: just as each part of one&#8217;s own body
      was precious, so long as it was present and could serve a useful
      purpose.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_211" href="#Footnotev1_3_211"><span
          class="sp">211</span></a> Some branches of virtue might be
      possessed by persons who were not wise: and bodily training was a
      valuable auxiliary to virtue. Even the wise man could never escape
      pain and fear, for both of these were natural: but he would keep
      clear of envy, passionate love, and superstition, which were not
      natural, but consequences of vain opinion. A thorough acquaintance
      with the real nature of Good and Evil would relieve him from

    <p>The Kyrenaics did not admit that there was anything just, or
      honourable, or base, by nature: but only by law and custom:
      nevertheless the wise man would be sufficiently restrained, by the
      fear of punishment and of discredit, from doing what was repugnant
      to the society in which he lived. They maintained that wisdom was
      attainable; that the senses did not at first judge truly, but
      might be improved by study; that progress was realised in
      philosophy as in other arts, and that there were different
      gradations of it, as well as different gradations of pain and
      suffering, discernible in different men. The wise man, as they
      conceived him, was a reality; not (like the wise man of the

    <p>Such were (as far as our imperfect evidence goes) the ethical and

      knowledge, they <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page198"

      we could know nothing at all. Partly for this reason, they
      abstained from all attention to the study of nature &#8212; to astronomy
      and physics: partly also because they did not see any bearing of
      these subjects upon good and evil, or upon the conduct of life.

    <p>Such low estimation of mathematics and physics and attention
      given almost exclusively to the feelings and conduct of human life
      &#8212; is a point common to the opposite schools of Aristippus and
      Antisthenes, derived by both of them from Sokrates. Herein Plato
      stands apart from all the three. </p>
    <p>The theory of Aristippus, as given above, is only derived from a
      meagre abstract and from a few detached hints. We do not know how
      he himself stated it: still less how he enforced and vindicated
      it. &#8212; He, as well as Antisthenes, composed dialogues: which
      naturally implies diversity of handling. Their main thesis,
      therefore &#8212; the text, as it were, upon which they debated or
      expatiated (which is all that the abstract gives) &#8212; affords very
      inadequate means, even if we could rely upon the accuracy of the
      statement, for appreciating their philosophical competence. We
      should form but a poor idea of the acute, abundant, elastic and
      diversified dialectic of Plato, if all his dialogues had been lost
      &#8212; and if we had nothing to rely upon except the summary of
      Platonism prepared by Diogenes Laertius: which summary,
      nevertheless, is more copious and elaborate than the same author
      has furnished either of Aristippus or Antisthenes. </p>

    <p>In the history of the Greek mind these two last-mentioned
      philosophers (though included by Cicero among the <i>plebeii
        philosophi</i>) are not less important than Plato and Aristotle.
      The speculations and precepts of Antisthenes passed, with various
      enlargements and modifications, into the Stoic philosophy: those
      of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page199" id="v1page199"></a>199</span>Aristippus



      into the Epikurean: the two most widely extended ethical sects in
      the subsequent Pagan world. &#8212; The Cynic sect, as it stood before
      it embraced the enlarged physical, kosmical, and social theories
      of Zeno and his contemporaries, reducing to a minimum all the
      desires and appetites &#8212; cultivating insensibility to the pains of
      life, and even disdainful insensibility to its pleasures &#8212;
      required extraordinary force of will and obstinate resolution, but
      little beyond. Where there was no selection or discrimination, the
      most ordinary prudence sufficed. It was otherwise with the scheme
      of Aristippus and the Kyrenaics: which, if it tasked less severely
      the powers of endurance, demanded a far higher measure of
      intelligent prudence. Selection of that which might safely be
      enjoyed, and determination of the limit within which enjoyment
      must be confined, were constantly indispensable. Prudence,
      knowledge, the art of mensuration or calculation, were essential
      to Aristippus, and ought to be put in the foreground when his
      theory is stated. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_3_84"

    <p>That theory is, in point of fact, identical with the theory
      expounded by the Platonic Sokrates in Plato&#8217;s Protagoras. The
      general features of both are the same. Sokrates there lays it down
      explicitly, that pleasure <i>per se</i> is always good, and pain
      <i>per se</i> always evil: that there is no other good (<i>per se</i>)
      except pleasure and diminution of pain &#8212; no other evil (<i>per se</i>)
      except pain and diminution of pleasure: that there is no other
      object in life except to live through it as much as possible with
      pleasures and without pains;<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_215"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_215"><span class="sp">215</span></a> but
      that many pleasures become evil, because they cannot be had
      without depriving us of greater pleasures or imposing upon us
      greater pains while many pains become good, because they prevent
      greater pains or ensure greater pleasures: that the safety of life
      thus lies in a correct comparison of the more or less in pleasures
      and pains, and in a selection founded thereupon. In other words,
      the safety of life <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page200"

        &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#949;. </p>
      <p>The exposition of this theory, by the Platonic Sokrates,
        occupies the latter portion of the Protagoras, from p. 351 to
        near the conclusion. See below, <a

        present work. </p>
      <p>The language held by Aristippus to Sokrates, in the Xenophontic
        dialogue (Memor. ii. 1. 9), is exactly similar to that of the
        Platonic Sokrates, as above cited &#8212; &#7952;&#956;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#969; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;

          id="Sidenotev1_3_85"></a>Difference in the manner of stating
        the theory by the two.</span> </p>
    <p>The theory here laid down by the Platonic Sokrates is the same as
      that of Aristippus. The purpose of life is stated almost in the
      same words by both: by the Platonic Sokrates, and by Aristippus in
      the Xenophontic dialogue &#8212; &#8220;to live through with enjoyment and
      without suffering.&#8221; The Platonic Sokrates denies, quite as
      emphatically as Aristippus, any good or evil, honourable or base,
      except as representing the result of an intelligent comparison of
      pleasures and pains. Judicious calculation is postulated by both:
      pleasures and pains being assumed by both as the only ends of
      pursuit and avoidance, to which calculation is to be applied. The
      main difference is, that the prudence, art, or science, required
      for making this calculation rightly, are put forward by the
      Platonic Sokrates as the prominent item in his provision for
      passing through life: whereas, in the scheme of Aristippus, as far
      as we know it, such accomplished intelligence, though equally
      recognised and implied, is not equally thrust into the foreground.
      So it appears at least in the abstract which we possess of his
      theory; if we had his own exposition of it, perhaps we might find
      the case otherwise. In that abstract, indeed, we find the writer
      replying to those who affirmed prudence or knowledge, to be good <i>per



        se</i> &#8212; and maintaining that it is only good by reason of its
      consequences:<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_216" href="#Footnotev1_3_216"><span
          class="sp">216</span></a> that is, that it is not good as End,
      in the same sense in which pleasure or mitigation, of pain are
      good. This point of the theory, however, coincides again with the
      doctrine of the Platonic Sokrates in the Protagoras: where the art
      of calculation is extolled simply as an indispensable condition to
      the most precious results of human happiness. </p>

    </div>
    <p>What I say here applies especially to the Protagoras: for I am
      well aware that in other dialogues the Platonic Sokrates is made
      to hold different language.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_217"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_217"><span class="sp">217</span></a> But in
      the Protagoras he <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page201"
          id="v1page201"></a>201</span>defends a theory the same as that
      of Aristippus, and defends it by an elaborate argument which
      silences the objections of the Sophist Protagoras; who at first
      will not admit the unqualified identity of the pleasurable,
      judiciously estimated and selected, with the good. The general and
      comprehensive manner in which Plato conceives and expounds the
      theory, is probably one evidence of his superior philosophical
      aptitude as compared with Aristippus and his other contemporaries.
      He enunciates, side by side, and with equal distinctness, the two
      conditions requisite for his theory of life. 1. The calculating or
      measuring art. 2. A description of the items to which alone such
      measurement must be applied &#8212; pleasures and pains. &#8212; These two
      together make the full theory. In other dialogues Plato insists
      equally upon the necessity of knowledge or calculating prudence:
      but then he is not equally distinct in specifying the items to
      which such prudence or calculation is to be applied. On the other
      hand, it is quite possible that Aristippus, in laying out the same
      theory, may have dwelt with peculiar emphasis upon the other
      element in the theory: <i>i.e.</i> that while expressly insisting
      upon pleasures and pains, as the only data to be compared, he may
      have tacitly assumed the comparing or calculating intelligence, as
      if it were understood by itself, and did not require to be
      formally proclaimed. </p>

    <p>A distinction must here be made between the general theory of
      life laid down by Aristippus &#8212; and the particular application
      which he made of that theory to his own course of proceeding. What
      we may observe is, that the Platonic Sokrates (in the Protagoras)
      agrees in the first, or general theory: whether he would have
      agreed in the second (or application to the particular case) we
      are not informed, but we may probably assume the negative. And we
      find Sokrates (in the Xenophontic dialogue) taking the same
      negative ground against Aristippus &#8212; upon the second point, not
      upon the first. He seeks to prove that the course of conduct
      adopted by Aristippus, instead of carrying with it a preponderance
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page202" id="v1page202"></a>202</span>of



      pleasure, will entail a preponderance of pain. He does not dispute
      the general theory. </p>

    <p>Though Aristippus and the Kyrenaic sect are recognised as the
      first persons who laid down this general theory, yet various
      others apart from them adopted it likewise. We may see this not
      merely from the Protagoras of Plato, but also from the fact that
      Aristotle, when commenting upon the theory in his Ethics,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_3_218" href="#Footnotev1_3_218"><span
          class="sp">218</span></a> cites Eudoxus (eminent both as
      mathematician and astronomer, besides being among the hearers of
      Plato) as its principal champion. Still the school of
      Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc; are recorded as a continuous body, partly
      defending, partly modifying the theory of Aristippus.<a

        Sydenham, in his notes on Phil&ecirc;bus (note 39, p. 76),
        accuses Aristippus and the Kyrenaics of prevarication and
        sophistry in the statement of their doctrine respecting
        Pleasure. He says that they called it indiscriminately &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8056;&#957;
        and &#964;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957; &#8212; (a good &#8212; The Good) &#8212; &#8220;they used the fallacy of
        changing a particular term for a term which is universal, or
        vice vers&acirc;, by the sly omission or insertion of the
        definite article <i>The</i> before the word Good&#8221; (p. 78). He
        contrasts with this prevarication the ingenuousness of Eudoxus,
        as the advocate of Pleasure (Aristot. Eth. N. x. 2). I know no
        evidence for either of these allegations: either for the
        prevarication of Aristippus or the ingenuousness of Eudoxus.</p>

    <p>Diogenes Laertius had read a powerfully written book of

      Cicero also mentions a composition of Hegesias.<a

          class="sp">220</span></a> Of Annikeris we know none; but he,
      too, probably, must have been an author. The doctrines which we
      find ascribed to these Kyrenaics evince how much affinity there
      was, at bottom, between them and the Cynics, in spite of the great
      apparent opposition. Hegesias received the surname of the
      Death-Persuader: he considered happiness to be quite unattainable,
      and death to be an object not of fear, but of welcome acceptance,
      in the eyes of a wise man. He started from the same basis as
      Aristippus: pleasure as the <i>expetendum</i>, pain as the <i>fugiendum</i>,
      to which all our personal friendships and aversions were
      ultimately referable. But he considered that the pains of life
      preponderated over the pleasures, even under the <span

      favourable circumstances. For conferring pleasure, or for securing
      continuance of pleasure &#8212; wealth, high birth, freedom, glory, were
      of no greater avail than their contraries poverty, low birth,
      slavery, ignominy. There was nothing which was, by nature or
      universally, either pleasurable or painful. Novelty, rarity,
      satiety, rendered one thing pleasurable, another painful, to
      different persons and at different times. The wise man would show
      his wisdom, not in the fruitless struggle for pleasures, but in
      the avoidance or mitigation of pains: which he would accomplish
      more successfully by rendering himself indifferent to the causes
      of pleasure. He would act always for his own account, and would
      value himself higher than other persons: but he would at the same
      time reflect that the mistakes of these others were involuntary,
      and he would give them indulgent counsel, instead of hating them.
      He would not trust his senses as affording any real knowledge: but
      he would be satisfied to act upon the probable appearances of
      sense, or upon phenomenal knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_221"

        renunciation of pleasure &#8212; coincidence with the Cynics. </span></p>
    <p>Such is the summary which we read of the doctrines of Hegesias:
      who is said to have enforced his views,<a name="FnAnchorv1_3_222"
        href="#Footnotev1_3_222"><span class="sp">222</span></a> &#8212; of
      the real character of life, as containing a great preponderance of
      misfortune and suffering &#8212; in a manner so persuasive, that several
      persons were induced to commit suicide. Hence he was prohibited by
      the first Ptolemy from lecturing in such a strain. His opinions
      respecting life coincide in the main with those set forth by
      Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;don of Plato: which dialogue also is
      alleged to have operated so powerfully on the Platonic disciple
      Kleombrotus, that he was induced to terminate his own existence.
      Hegesias, agreeing with Aristippus that pleasure would be the
      Good, if you could get it &#8212; maintains that the circumstances of
      life are such as to render pleasure unattainable: and therefore
      advises to renounce pleasure at once and systematically, in order
      that we may turn our attention to the only practicable end &#8212; that
      of lessening pain. Such deliberate renunciation of pleasure brings
      him into harmony with the doctrine of the Cynics. </p>

        the Kyrenaics, as well as by Protagoras. </span></p>
    <p>On another point, however, Hegesias repeats just the same
      doctrine as Aristippus. Both deny any thing like absolute
      knowledge: they maintain that all our knowledge is phenomenal, or
      relative to our own impressions or affections: that we neither do
      know, nor can know, anything about any real or supposed
      ultra-phenomenal object, <i>i.e.</i>, things in themselves, as
      distinguished from our own impressions and apart from our senses
      and other capacities. Having no writings of Aristippus left, we
      know this doctrine only as it is presented by others, and those
      too opponents. We cannot tell whether Aristippus or his supporters
      stated their own doctrine in such a way as to be open to the
      objections which we read as urged by opponents. But the doctrine
      itself is not, in my judgment, refuted by any of those objections.
      &#8220;Our affections (&#960;&#940;&#952;&#951;) alone are known to us, but not the supposed
      objects or causes from which they proceed.&#8221; The word rendered by <i>affections</i>
      must here be taken in its most general and comprehensive sense &#8212;
      as including not merely sensations, but also remembrances,
      emotions, judgments, beliefs, doubts, volitions, conscious
      energies, &amp;c. Whatever we know, we can know only as it appears
      to, or implicates itself somehow with, our own minds. All the
      knowledge which I possess, is an aggregate of propositions
      affirming facts, and the order or conjunction of facts, as they
      are, or have been, or may be, relative to myself. This doctrine of
      Aristippus is in substance the same as that which Protagoras
      announced in other words as &#8212; &#8220;Man is the measure of all things&#8221;.
      I have already explained and illustrated it, at considerable
      length, in my chapter on the Platonic The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, where
      it is announced by The&aelig;tetus and controverted by Sokrates.<a

          xxviii.</a> Compare Aristokles ap. Eusebium, Pr&aelig;p. Ev.
        xiv. 18, 19, and Sextus Emp. adv. Mathemat. vii. 190-197, vi.
        53. Sextus gives a summary of this doctrine of the Kyrenaics,
        more fair and complete than that given by Aristokles &#8212; at least
        so far as the extract from the latter in Eusebius enables us to
        judge. Aristokles impugns it vehemently, and tries to fasten
        upon it many absurd consequences &#8212; in my judgment without
        foundation. It is probable that by the term &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962; the Kyrenaics
        meant simply sensations internal and external: and that the
        question, as they handled it, was about the reality of the
        supposed Substratum or Object of sense, independent of any
        sentient Subject. It is also probable that, in explaining their
        views, they did not take account of the memory of past
        sensations &#8212; and the expectation of future sensations, in
        successions or conjunctions more or less similar &#8212; associating
        in the mind with the sensation present and actual, to <span
          class="pagenum"><a name="v1page205" id="v1page205"></a>205</span>form



        what is called a permanent object of sense. I think it likely
        that they set forth their own doctrine in a narrow and
        inadequate manner. </p>
      <p>But this defect is noway corrected by Aristokles their
        opponent. On the contrary, he attacks them on their strong side:
        he vindicates against them the hypothesis of the ultra
        phenomenal, absolute, transcendental Object, independent of and
        apart from any sensation, present, past, or future &#8212; and from
        any sentient Subject. Besides that, he assumes them to deny, or
        ignore, many points which their theory noway requires them to
        deny. He urges one argument which, when properly understood,
        goes not against them, but strongly in their favour. &#8220;If these
        philosophers,&#8221; says Aristokles (Eus. xiv. 19, 1), &#8220;know that
        they experience sensation and perceive, they must know something
        beyond the sensation itself. If I say &#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#954;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;, &#8216;I am being
        burned,&#8217; this is a proposition, not a sensation. These three
        things are of necessity co-essential &#8212; the sensation itself, the
        Object which causes it, the Subject which feels it (&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#947;&#949;
        &#964;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#965;&#966;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#8212; &#964;&#972; &#964;&#949; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;
        &#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#959;&#957;).&#8221; In trying to make good his conclusion &#8212; That you
        cannot know the sensation without the Object of sense &#8212;
        Aristokles at the same time asserts that the Object cannot be
        known apart from the sensation, nor apart from the knowing
        Subject. He asserts that the three are by necessity <i>co-essential



          &#8212; i.e.</i> implicated and indivisible in substance and
        existence: if distinguishable therefore, distinguishable only
        logically (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8048;), admitting of being looked at in
        different points of view. But this is exactly the case of his
        opponents, when properly stated. They do not deny Object: they
        do not deny Subject: but they deny the independent and separate
        existence of the one as well as of the other: they admit the two
        only as relative to each other, or as reciprocally implicated in
        the indivisible fact of cognition. The reasoning of Aristokles
        thus goes to prove the opinion which he is trying to refute.
        Most of the arguments, which Sextus adduces in favour of the
        Kyrenaic doctrine, show forcibly that the Objective Something,
        apart from its Subjective correlate, is unknowable and a
        non-entity; but he does not include in the Subjective as much as
        ought to be included; he takes note only of the present
        sensation, and does not include sensations remembered or
        anticipated. Another very forcible part of Sextus&#8217;s reasoning
        may be found, vii. sect. 269-272, where he shows that a logical
        Subject <i>per se</i> is undefinable and inconceivable &#8212; that
        those who attempt to define Man (<i>e.g.</i>) do so by
        specifying more or fewer of the predicates of Man &#8212; and that if
        you suppose all the predicates to vanish, the Subject vanishes
        along with them.</p>

        a man of action and not a theorist &#8212; the Sokratic element in him
        an accessory.</span></p>
    <p>There remains one other companion of Sokrates, for whom a
      dignified place must be reserved in this volume &#8212; Xenophon the son
      of Gryllus. It is to him that we owe, in great part, such
      knowledge as we possess of the real Sokrates. For the Sokratic
      conversations related by Xenophon, though doubtless dressed up and
      expanded by him, appear to me reports in the main of what Sokrates
      actually said. Xenophon was sparing in the introduction of his
      master as titular spokesman for opinions, theories, or
      controversial difficulties, generated in his own mind: a practice
      in which Plato indulged without any reserve, as we have seen by
      the numerous dialogues already passed in review. </p>
    <p>I shall not however give any complete analysis of Xenophon&#8217;s
      works: because both the greater part of them, and the leading
      features of his personal character, belong rather to active than
      to speculative Hellenic life. As such, I have dealt with them
      largely in my History of Greece. What I have here to illustrate is
      the Sokratic element in his character, which is important indeed
      as accessory and modifying &#8212; yet not fundamental. Though he
      exemplifies and attests, as a witness, the theorising negative
      vein, the cross-examining Elenchus of Sokrates it is the
      preceptorial vein which he appropriates to himself and expands in
      its bearing on practical conduct. He is the semi-philosophising
      general; undervalued indeed as a hybrid by Plato &#8212; but by
      high-minded Romans like Cato, Agricola, Helvidius Priscus, &amp;c.

      cheerfully the danger and fatigues of soldiership, and who

      largely from his Hellenica and Anabasis: and we learn much even
      from his other productions, not properly historical; for he never
      soars high in the region of ideality, nor grasps at etherial
      visions &#8212; &#8220;nubes et inania&#8221; &#8212; like Plato. </p>

    <p>Respecting the personal history of Xenophon himself, we possess
      but little information: nor do we know the year either of his
      birth or death. His Hellenica concludes with the battle of
      Mantineia in 362 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>. But he makes
      incidental mention in that work of an event five years later &#8212; the
      assassination of Alexander, despot of Pher&aelig;, which took
      place in 357 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a

      &#8212; and his language seems to imply that the event was described
      shortly after it took place. His pamphlet De Vectigalibus appears
      to have been composed still later &#8212; not before 355 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> In the year 400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
      when Xenophon joined the Grecian military force assembled at
      Sardis to accompany Cyrus the younger in his march to Babylon, he
      must have been still a young man: yet he had even then established
      an intimacy with Sokrates at Athens: and he was old enough to call
      himself the &#8220;ancient guest&#8221; of the B&#339;otian Proxenus, who engaged
      him to come and take service with Cyrus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_4"

      life, we have no facts before us: but we may confidently affirm
      (as I have already observed about<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_5"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Plato),
      that as he became liable to military service in 412 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the severe pressure of the war upon
      Athens must have occasioned him to be largely employed, among
      other citizens, for the defence of his native city, until its
      capture in 405 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> He seems to have
      belonged to an equestrian family in the census, and therefore to
      have served on horseback. More than one of his compositions

      familiarity with horses. </p>

        the Athenian cavalry at the battle of Delium (424 <span

        Sokrates, I consider to be not less inconsistent with any

        distinguished himself at the battle of Delium. See below, <a

        Sokrates &#8212; takes the opinion of the Delphian oracle.</span></p>
    <p>Our knowledge of his personal history begins with what he himself
      recounts in the Anabasis. His friend Proxenus, then at Sardis
      commanding a regiment of Hellenic mercenaries under Cyrus the
      younger, wrote recommending him earnestly to come over and take
      service, in the army prepared ostensibly against the Pisidians.
      Upon this Xenophon asked the advice of Sokrates: who exhorted him
      to go and consult the Delphian oracle &#8212; being apprehensive that as
      Cyrus had proved himself the strenuous ally of Sparta, and had
      furnished to her the principal means for crushing Athens, an
      Athenian taking service under him would incur unpopularity at
      home. Xenophon accordingly went to Delphi: but instead of asking
      the question broadly &#8212; &#8220;Shall I go, or shall I decline to go?&#8221; &#8212;
      he put to Apollo the narrower question &#8212; &#8220;Having in contemplation
      a journey, to which of the Gods must I sacrifice and pray, in
      order to accomplish it best, and to come back with safety and
      success?&#8221; Apollo indicated to him the Gods to whom he ought to
      address himself: but Sokrates was displeased with him for not
      having first asked, whether he ought to go at all. Nevertheless
      (continued Sokrates), since you have chosen to put the question in
      your own way you must act as the God has prescribed.<a

    <p>The anecdote here recounted by Xenophon is interesting, as it
      illustrates his sincere faith, as well as that of Sokrates, in the
      Delphian oracle: though we might have expected that on this
      occasion, Sokrates would have been favoured with some
      manifestation of that divine sign, which he represents to have
      warned him afterwards so frequently and on such trifling matters.
      Apollo however was perhaps displeased (as Sokrates was) with
      Xenophon, for not having submitted the question to him with full
      frankness: since the answer given was proved by subsequent
      experience to be incomplete.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_7"

      fifteen months passed, first, in the hard upward march &#8212; next, in
      the still harder retreat &#8212; of the Ten Thousand, to the
      preservation of whom he largely contributed by his energy,
      presence of mind, resolute initiative, and ready Athenian
      eloquence, as one of their leaders &#8212; Xenophon returned to Athens.
      It appears that he must have come back not long after the death of
      Sokrates. But Athens was not at that time a pleasant residence for
      him. The Sokratic companions shared in the unpopularity of their
      deceased master, and many of them were absent: moreover Xenophon
      himself was unpopular as the active partisan of Cyrus. After a
      certain stay, we know not how long, at Athens, Xenophon appears to
      have gone back to Asia; and to have resumed his command of the
      remaining Cyreian soldiers, then serving under the
      Laced&aelig;monian generals against the Persian satraps
      Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus. He served first under Derkyllidas,
      next under Agesilaus. For the latter he conceived the warmest
      admiration, and contracted with him an intimate friendship. At the
      time when Xenophon rejoined the Cyreians in Asia, Athens was not
      at war with the Laced&aelig;monians: but after some time, the
      hostile confederacy of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, against them
      was organised: and Agesilaus was summoned home by them from Asia,
      to fight their battles in <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page210" id="v1page210"></a>210</span>Greece. Xenophon
      and his Cyreians were still a portion of the army of Agesilaus,
      and accompanied him in his march into B&#339;otia; where they took part
      in his desperate battle and bloody victory at Koroneia.<a

      But he was now lending active aid to the enemies of Athens, and
      holding conspicuous command in their armies. A sentence of
      banishment, on the ground of Laconism, was passed against him by
      the Athenians, on the proposition of Eubulus.<a

      <p>Sokrates and Xenophon are among the most imposing witnesses
        cited by Quintus Cicero, in his long pleading to show the
        reality of divination (Cicero, De Divinatione, i. 25, 52, i. 54,
        122). Antipater the Stoic collected a large number of examples,
        illustrating the miraculous divining power of Sokrates. Several
        of these examples appear much more trifling than this incident
        of Xenophon.</p>

    <p>How long he served with Agesilaus, we are not told. At the end of
      his service, the Laced&aelig;monians provided him with a house and
      land at the Triphylian town of Skill&ucirc;s near Olympia, which
      they had seemingly taken from the Eleians and re-colonised. Near
      this residence he also purchased, under the authority of the God
      (perhaps Olympian Zeus) a landed estate to be consecrated to the
      Goddess Artemis: employing therein a portion of the tithe of
      plunder devoted to Artemis by the Cyreian army, and deposited by
      him for the time in the care of Megabyzus, priest of Artemis at
      Ephesus. The estate of the Goddess contained some cultivated
      ground, but consisted chiefly of pasture; with wild ground, wood
      and mountain, abounding in game and favourable for hunting.
      Xenophon became Conservator of this property for Artemis: to whom
      he dedicated a shrine and a statue, in miniature copy of the great
      temple at Ephesus. Every year he held a formal hunting-match, to
      which he invited all the neighbours, with abundant hospitality, at
      the expense of the Goddess. The Conservator and his successors
      were bound by formal vow, on pain of her displeasure, to employ
      one tenth of the whole annual produce in sacrifices to her: and to
      keep the shrine and statue in good order, out of the remainder.<a

    <p>From the brief outline thus presented of Xenophon&#8217;s life, it will
      plainly appear that he was quite different in character and habits
      from Plato and the other Sokratic brethren. He was not only a man
      of the world (as indeed Aristippus was also), but he was actively
      engaged in the most responsible and difficult functions of
      military command: he was moreover a landed proprietor and
      cultivator, fond of strong exercise with dogs and horses, and an
      intelligent equestrian. His circumstances were sufficiently easy
      to dispense with the necessity of either composing discourses or
      taking pupils for money. Being thus enabled to prosecute letters
      and philosophy in an independent way, he did not, like Plato and
      Aristotle, open a school.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_16"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> His
      relations, as active coadjutor and subordinate, with Agesilaus,
      form a striking contrast to those of Plato with Dionysius, as
      tutor and pedagogue. In his mind, the Sokratic conversations,
      suggestive and stimulating to every one, fell upon the
      dispositions and aptitudes of a citizen-soldier, and fructified in
      a peculiar manner. My present work deals with Xenophon, not as an
      historian of Grecian affairs or of the Cyreian expedition, but
      only on the intellectual and theorising side:&#8212;as author of the

        Theodekt&ecirc;s of Phas&ecirc;lis, Naukrates of Erythr&aelig;,
        and himself (Theopompus). He himself and Naukrates were in good
        circumstances, so that he passed his life in independent
        prosecution of philosophy and philomathy. But Isokrates and
        Theodekt&ecirc;s were compelled &#948;&#953;&#8217; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#946;&#943;&#959;&#965;, &#956;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#962;

      <p>Theopompus does not here present the profession of a Sophist

        &#338;konomikus, &amp;c.</span></p>
    <p>The Memorabilia were composed as records of the conversations of
      Sokrates, expressly intended to vindicate Sokrates against charges
      of impiety and of corrupting youthful minds, and to show that he
      inculcated, before every thing, self-denial, moderation of
      desires, reverence for parents, and worship of the Gods. The
      &#338;konomikus and the Symposion are expansions of the Memorabilia:
      the first<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_17" href="#Footnotev1_4_17"><span
          class="sp">17</span></a> exhibiting Sokrates not only as an
      attentive observer of the facts of active life (in which character
      the Memorabilia present him also), but even as a learner of
      husbandry<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_18" href="#Footnotev1_4_18"><span
          class="sp">18</span></a> and family management from
      Ischomachus &#8212; the last describing Sokrates and his behaviour
      amidst the fun and joviality of a convivial company. Sokrates
      declares<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_19" href="#Footnotev1_4_19"><span
          class="sp">19</span></a> that as to himself, though poor, he
      is quite as rich as he desires to be; that he desires no increase,
      and regards poverty as no disadvantage. Yet since Kratobulus,
      though rich, is beset with temptations to expense quite sufficient
      to embarrass him, good proprietary management is to him a
      necessity. Accordingly, Sokrates, announcing that he has always
      been careful to inform himself who were the best economists in the
      city,<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_20" href="#Footnotev1_4_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a> now cites as authority Ischomachus, a

      the &#8220;super-excellent&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_21"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
      Ischomachus loves wealth, and is anxious to maintain and even
      enlarge his property: desiring to spend magnificently for the
      honour of the Gods, the assistance of friends, and the support of
      the city.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_22" href="#Footnotev1_4_22"><span

        href="#Footnotev1_4_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> and

      enthusiasm, of husbandry, as an occupation not merely profitable,
      but improving to the character: though he treats with disrespect
      other branches of industry and craft.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_24"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> In regard
      to husbandry, too, as in regard to war or steersmanship, he
      affirms that the difference between one practitioner and another
      consists, not so much in unequal knowledge, as in unequal care to
      practise what both of them know.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_25"

        Galen calls the &#338;konomicus the last book of the Memorabilia (ad
        Hippokrat. De Articulis, t. xviii. p. 301, K&uuml;hn). It
        professes to be repeated by Xenophon from what he himself <i>heard</i>
        Sokrates say &#8212; &#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945; &#948;&#941; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#949; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#949;
        &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;, &amp;c. Sokrates first instructs Kritobulus that
        economy, or management of property, is an art, governed by
        rules, and dependent upon principles; next, he recounts to him
        the lessons which he professes to have himself received from
        Ischomachus. </p>

    <p>Ischomachus describes to Sokrates, in reply to a string of
      successive questions, both his scheme of life and his scheme of
      husbandry. He had married his wife before she was fifteen years of
      age: having first ascertained that she had been brought up
      carefully, so as to have seen and heard as little as possible, and
      to know nothing but spinning and weaving.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_26"

      describes how he took this very young wife into training, so as to
      form her to the habits which he himself approved. He declares that
      the duties and functions of women are confined to in-door work and
      superintendence, while the out-door proceedings, acquisition as
      well as defence, belong to men:<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_27"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> he
      insists upon such separation of functions emphatically, as an
      ordinance of nature &#8212; holding an opinion the direct reverse of
      that which we have seen expressed by Plato.<a

      He makes many remarks on the arrangements of the house, and of the

    <p>It is upon this last point that he lays more stress than upon any
      other. To know how to command men &#8212; is the first of all

      as essential that the superior shall not merely give orders to his
      subordinates, but also see them executed, and set the example of
      personal active watchfulness in every way. Xenophon aims at
      securing not simply obedience, but cheerful and willing obedience
      &#8212; even attachment from those who obey. &#8220;To exercise command over

      mind, from whence many of his most valuable speculations emanate.
      &#8220;What are the conditions under which subordinates will cheerfully
      obey their commanders?&#8221; &#8212; was a problem forced upon his thoughts
      by his own personal experience, as well as by contemporary
      phenomena in Hellas. He had been elected one of the generals of
      the Ten Thousand: a large body of brave warriors from different
      cities, most of them unknown to him personally, and inviting his
      authority only because they were in extreme peril, and because no
      one else took the initiative.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_30"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> He
      discharged his duties admirably: and his ready eloquence was an
      invaluable accomplishment, distinguishing him from all his
      colleagues. Nevertheless when the army arrived at the Euxine, out
      of the reach of urgent peril, he was made to feel sensibly the
      vexations of authority resting upon such precarious basis, and
      perpetually traversed by jealous rivals. Moreover, Xenophon,
      besides <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page216" id="v1page216"></a>216</span>his



      own personal experience, had witnessed violent political changes
      running extensively through the cities of the Grecian world:
      first, at the close of the Peloponnesian war &#8212; next, after the
      battle of Knidus &#8212; again, under Laced&aelig;monian supremacy,
      after the peace of Antalkidas, and the subsequent seizure of the
      citadel of Thebes &#8212; lastly, after the Thebans had regained their
      freedom and humbled the Laced&aelig;monians by the battle of
      Leuktra. To Xenophon &#8212; partly actor, partly spectator &#8212; these
      political revolutions were matters of anxious interest; especially
      as he ardently sympathised with Agesilaus, a political partisan
      interested in most of them, either as conservative or
      revolutionary.</p>

        Hieron and Cyrop&aelig;dia &#8212; Name of Sokrates not suitable.</span></p>
    <p>We thus see, from the personal history of Xenophon, how his
      attention came to be peculiarly turned to the difficulty of
      ensuring steady obedience from subordinates, and to the conditions
      by which such difficulty might be overcome. The sentence, above
      transcribed from the &#338;konomikus, embodies two texts upon which he
      has discoursed in two of his most interesting compositions &#8212;
      Cyrop&aelig;dia and Hieron. In Cyrop&aelig;dia he explains and
      exemplifies the divine gift of ruling over cheerful subordinates:
      in Hieron, the torment of governing the disaffected and
      refractory. For neither of these purposes would the name and
      person of Sokrates have been suitable, exclusively connected as
      they were with Athens. Accordingly Xenophon, having carried that
      respected name through the &#338;konomikus and Symposion, now dismisses
      it, yet retaining still the familiar and colloquial manner which
      belonged to Sokrates. The Epilogue, or concluding chapter, of the
      Cyrop&aelig;dia, must unquestionably have been composed after 364
      <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> &#8212; in the last ten years of
      Xenophon&#8217;s life: the main body of it may perhaps have been
      composed earlier. </p>

        Simonides and Hieron.</span></p>
    <p>The Hieron gives no indication of date: but as a picture purely
      Hellenic, it deserves precedence over the Cyrop&aelig;dia, and
      conveys to my mind the impression of having been written earlier.
      It describes a supposed conversation (probably suggested by
      current traditional conversations, like that between Solon and
      Kr&#339;sus) between the poet Simonides and Hieron the despot of
      Syracuse; who, shortly after the Persian invasion of Greece by
      Xerxes, had succeeded his <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page217" id="v1page217"></a>217</span> brother Gelon
      the former despot.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_31"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> Both of
      them had been once private citizens, of no remarkable consequence:
      but Gelon, an energetic and ambitious military man, having raised
      himself to power in the service of Hippokrates despot of Gela, had
      seized the sceptre on the death of his master: after which he
      conquered Syracuse, and acquired a formidable dominion, enjoyed
      after his death by his brother Hieron. This last was a great
      patron of eminent poets &#8212; Pindar, Simonides, &AElig;schylus,
      Bacchylides: but he laboured under a painful internal complaint,
      and appears to have been of an irritable and oppressive temper.<a

        in a passage of Aristophanes, Vesp&aelig;, 1362.</p>

        See the first and second Pythian Odes of Pindar, addressed to
        Hieron, especially Pyth. i. 55-61-90, with the Scholia and
        Boeckh&#8217;s Commentary. Pindar compliments Hieron upon having
        founded his new city of &AElig;tna &#8212; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#948;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#8179; &#963;&#8058;&#957; &#7952;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#8115;.
        This does not coincide with the view of Hieron&#8217;s character taken
        by Xenophon; but Pindar agrees with Xenophon in exhorting Hieron
        to make himself popular by a liberal expenditure.</p>

        by Simonides. Answer of Hieron.</span></p>
    <p>Simonides asks of Hieron, who had personally tried both the life
      of a private citizen and that of a despot, which of the two he
      considered preferable, in regard to pleasures and pains. Upon this
      subject, a conversation of some length ensues, in which Hieron
      declares that the life of a despot has much more pain, and much
      less pleasure, than that of a private citizen under middling
      circumstances:<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_33" href="#Footnotev1_4_33"><span
          class="sp">33</span></a> while Simonides takes the contrary
      side, and insists in detail upon the superior means of enjoyment,
      apparent at least, possessed by the despot. As each of these means
      is successively brought forward, Hieron shews that however the
      matter may appear to the spectator, the despot feels no greater
      real happiness in his own bosom: while he suffers many pains and
      privations, of which the spectator takes no account. As to the
      pleasures of sight, the despot forfeits altogether the first and
      greatest, because it is unsafe for him to visit the public
      festivals and matches. In regard to hearing &#8212; many praises, and no
      reproach, reach his ears: but then he knows that the praises are
      insincere &#8212; and that reproach is unheard, only because speakers
      dare not express what they really feel. The despot has finer
      cookery and richer unguents; but others enjoy a modest banquet <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page218" id="v1page218"></a>218</span>as



      much or more &#8212; while the scent of the unguents pleases those who
      are near him more than himself.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_34"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> Then as
      to the pleasures of love, these do not exist, except where the
      beloved person manifests spontaneous sympathy and return of
      attachment. Now the despot can never extort such return by his
      power; while even if it be granted freely, he cannot trust its
      sincerity and is compelled even to be more on his guard, since
      successful conspiracies against his life generally proceed from
      those who profess attachment to him.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_35"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> The
      private citizen on the contrary knows that those who profess to
      love him, may be trusted, as having no motive for falsehood. </p>

    <p>Still (contends Simonides) there are other pleasures greater than
      those of sense. You despots possess the greatest abundance and
      variety of possessions &#8212; the finest chariots and horses, the most
      splendid arms, the finest palaces, ornaments, and furniture &#8212; the
      most brilliant ornaments for your wives &#8212; the most intelligent and
      valuable servants. You execute the greatest enterprises: you can
      do most to benefit your friends, and hurt your enemies: you have
      all the proud consciousness of superior might.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_36" href="#Footnotev1_4_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
      &#8212; Such is the opinion of the multitude (replies Hieron), who are
      misled by appearances: but a wise man like you, Simonides, ought
      to see the reality in the background, and to recollect that
      happiness or unhappiness reside only in a man&#8217;s internal feelings.
      You cannot but know that a despot lives in perpetual insecurity,
      both at home and abroad: that he must always go armed himself, and
      have armed guards around him: that whether at war or at peace, he
      is always alike in danger: that, while suspecting every one as an
      enemy, he nevertheless knows that when he has put to death the
      persons suspected, he has only weakened the power of the city:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_37" href="#Footnotev1_4_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
      that he has no sincere friendship with any one: that he cannot
      count even upon good faith, and must cause all his food to be
      tasted by others, before he eats it: that whoever has slain a
      private citizen, is shunned in Grecian cities as an abomination <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page219" id="v1page219"></a>219</span>&#8212;
      while the tyrannicide is everywhere honoured and recompensed: that
      there is no safety for the despot even in his own family, many
      having been killed by their nearest relatives:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_38" href="#Footnotev1_4_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
      that he is compelled to rely upon mercenary foreign soldiers and
      liberated slaves, against the free citizens who hate him: and that
      the hire of such inauspicious protectors compels him to raise
      money, by despoiling individuals and plundering temples:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_39" href="#Footnotev1_4_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
      that the best and most estimable citizens are incurably hostile to
      him, while none but the worst will serve him for pay: that he
      looks back with bitter sorrow to the pleasures and confidential
      friendships which he enjoyed as a private man, but from which he
      is altogether debarred as a despot.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_40"

    <p>Nothing brings a man so near to the Gods (rejoins Simonides) as
      the feeling of being honoured. Power and a brilliant position must
      be of inestimable value, if they are worth purchasing at the price
      which you describe.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_41"

      Otherwise, why do you not throw up your sceptre? How happens it
      that no despot has ever yet done this? To be honoured (answers
      Hieron) is the greatest of earthly blessings, when a man obtains
      honour from the spontaneous voice of freemen. But a despot enjoys
      no such satisfaction. He lives like a criminal under sentence of
      death by every one: and it is impossible for him to lay down his
      power, because of the number of persons whom he has been obliged
      to make his enemies. He can neither endure his present condition,
      nor yet escape from it. The best thing he can do is to hang

      <p>Solon in his poems makes the remark, that for the man who once
        usurps the sceptre no retreat is possible. See my &#8216;History of
        Greece,&#8217; chap. xi. p. 132 seq.</p>
      <p>The impressive contrast here drawn by Hieron (c. vi.) between
        his condition as a despot and the past enjoyments of private
        life and citizenship which he has lost, reminds one of the still
        more sorrowful contrast in the Atys of Catullus, v. 58-70.</p>

        he should govern well, and thus make himself beloved by his
        subjects.</span></p>
    <p>Simonides in reply, after sympathising with Hieron&#8217;s despondency,
      undertakes to console him by showing that such consequences do not
      necessarily attend despotic rule. The despot&#8217;s power is an
      instrument <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page220"
          id="v1page220"></a>220</span>available for good as well as for
      evil. By a proper employment of it, he may not only avoid being
      hated, but may even make himself beloved, beyond the measure
      attainable by any private citizen. Even kind words, and petty
      courtesies, are welcomed far more eagerly when they come from a
      powerful man than from an equal: moreover a showy and brilliant
      exterior seldom fails to fascinate the spectator.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_43" href="#Footnotev1_4_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
      But besides this, the despot may render to his city the most
      substantial and important services. He may punish criminals and
      reward meritorious men: the punishments he ought to inflict by the
      hands of others, while he will administer the rewards in person &#8212;
      giving prizes for superior excellence in every department, and
      thus endearing himself to all.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_44"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> Such
      prizes would provoke a salutary competition in the performance of
      military duties, in choric exhibitions, in husbandry, commerce,
      and public usefulness of every kind. Even the foreign mercenaries,
      though usually odious, might be so handled and disciplined as to
      afford defence against foreign danger, &#8212; to ensure for the
      citizens undisturbed leisure in their own private affairs &#8212; to
      protect and befriend the honest man, and to use force only against
      criminals.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_45" href="#Footnotev1_4_45"><span
          class="sp">45</span></a> If thus employed, such mercenaries,
      instead of being hated, would be welcome companions: and the
      despot himself may count, not only upon security against attack,
      but upon the warmest gratitude and attachment. The citizens will
      readily furnish contributions to him when asked, and will regard
      him as their greatest benefactor. &#8220;You will obtain in this way&#8221;
      (Simonides thus concludes his address to Hieron), &#8220;the finest and
      most enviable of all acquisitions. You will have your subjects
      obeying you willingly, and caring for you of their own accord. You
      may travel safely wherever you please, and will be a welcome
      visitor at all the crowded festivals. You will be happy, without
      jealousy from any one.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_46"

        of the feelings at Olympia against Dionysius.</span></p>
    <p>The dialogue of which I have given this short abstract,
      illustrates what Xenophon calls the torment of Tantalus &#8212; the
      misery of a despot who has to extort obedience <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page221" id="v1page221"></a>221</span>from



      unwilling subjects:&#8212;especially if the despot be one who has once
      known the comfort and security of private life, under tolerably
      favourable circumstances. If we compare this dialogue with the
      Platonic Gorgias, where we have seen a thesis very analogous
      handled in respect to Archelaus, &#8212; we shall find Plato soaring
      into a sublime ethical region of his own, measuring the despot&#8217;s
      happiness and misery by a standard peculiar to himself, and making
      good what he admits to be a paradox by abundant eloquence covering
      faulty dialectic: while Xenophon, herein following his master,
      applies to human life the measure of a rational common sense,
      talks about pleasures and pains which every one can feel to be
      such, and points out how many of these pleasures the despot
      forfeits, how many of these pains and privations he undergoes, &#8212;
      in spite of that great power of doing hurt, and less power, though
      still considerable, of doing good, which raises the envy of
      spectators. The Hieron gives utterance to an interesting vein of
      sentiment, more common at Athens than elsewhere in Greece;
      enforced by the conversation of Sokrates, and serving as
      corrective protest against that unqualified worship of power which
      prevailed in the ancient world no less than in the modern. That
      the Syrakusan Hieron should be selected as an exemplifying name,
      may be explained by the circumstance, that during thirty-eight
      years of Xenophon&#8217;s mature life (405-367 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>),



      Dionysius the elder was despot of Syrakuse; a man of energy and
      ability, who had extinguished the liberties of his native city,
      and acquired power and dominion greater than that of any living
      Greek. Xenophon, resident at Skillus, within a short distance from
      Olympia, had probably<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_47"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> seen the
      splendid Th&ecirc;ory (or sacred legation of representative
      envoys) installed in rich and ornamented tents, and the fine
      running horses sent by Dionysius, at the ninety-ninth Olympic
      festival (384 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>): but he probably
      also heard the execration with which the name of Dionysius himself
      had been received by the spectators, and he would feel that the
      despot could hardly shew himself there in person. There were
      narratives in circulation about the interior life of Dionysius,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_48" href="#Footnotev1_4_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
      analogous to those statements which Xenophon <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page222" id="v1page222"></a>222</span>puts



      into the mouth of Hieron. A predecessor of Dionysius as despot of
      Syracuse<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_49" href="#Footnotev1_4_49"><span
          class="sp">49</span></a> and also as patron of poets, was
      therefore a suitable person to choose for illustrating the first
      part of Xenophon&#8217;s thesis &#8212; the countervailing pains and penalties
      which spoilt all the value of power, if exercised over unwilling
      and repugnant subjects.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_50"

        An anecdote is told about a visit of Xenophon to Dionysius at
        Syracuse &#8212; whether the elder or the younger is not specified &#8212;
        but the tenor of the anecdote points to the younger; if so the
        visit must have been later than 367 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        (Athen&aelig;us x. 427).</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_4_19"
          id="Sidenotev1_4_19"></a>Xenophon could not have chosen a
        Grecian despot to illustrate his theory of the happiness of
        governing willing subjects.</span></p>
    <p>But when Xenophon came to illustrate the second part of his
      thesis &#8212; the possibility of exercising power in such manner as to
      render the holder of it popular and beloved &#8212; it would have been
      scarcely possible for him to lay the scene in any Grecian city.
      The repugnance of the citizens of a Grecian city towards a despot
      who usurped power over them, was incurable &#8212; however much the more
      ambitious individuals among them might have wished to obtain such
      power for themselves: a repugnance as great among oligarchs as
      among democrats &#8212; perhaps even greater. When we read the
      recommendations addressed by Simonides, teaching Hieron how he
      might render himself popular, we perceive at once that they are
      alike well intentioned and ineffectual. Xenophon could neither
      find any real Grecian despot corresponding to this portion of his
      illustrative purpose &#8212; nor could he invent one with any shew of
      plausibility. He was forced to resort to other countries and other
      habits different from those of Greece. </p>

        and Persian customs &#8212; Xenophon&#8217;s experience of Cyrus the
        Younger.</span></p>
    <p>To this necessity probably we owe the Cyrop&aelig;dia: a romance
      in which Persian and Grecian experience are singularly blended,
      and both of them so transformed as to suit the philosophical
      purpose of the narrator. Xenophon had personally served and
      communicated with Cyrus the younger: respecting whom also he had
      large means of information, from his intimate friend Proxenus, as
      well as from the other Grecian generals of the expedition. In the
      first book of the Anabasis, we find this young prince depicted as
      an energetic and magnanimous <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page223" id="v1page223"></a>223</span>character,
      faithful to his word and generous in his friendships &#8212; inspiring
      strong attachment in those around him, yet vigorous in
      administration and in punishing criminals &#8212; not only courting the
      Greeks as useful for his ambitious projects, but appreciating
      sincerely the superiority of Hellenic character and freedom over
      Oriental servitude.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_51"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> And in
      the &#338;konomikus, Cyrus is quoted as illustrating in his character
      the true virtue of a commander; the test of which Xenophon
      declares to be &#8212; That his subordinates follow him willingly, and
      stand by him to the death.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_52"

        education &#8212; Preface to the Cyrop&aelig;dia.</span></p>
    <p>It is this character Hellenised, Sokratised, idealised &#8212; that
      Xenophon paints into his glowing picture of Cyrus the founder of
      the Persian monarchy, or the Cyrop&aelig;dia. He thus escapes the
      insuperable difficulty arising from the position of a Grecian
      despot; who never could acquire willing or loving obedience,
      because his possession of power was felt by a majority of his
      subjects to be wrongful, violent, tainted. The Cyrus of the
      Cyrop&aelig;dia begins as son of Kambyses, king or chief of
      Persia, and grandson of Astyages, king of Media; recognised
      according to established custom by all, as the person to whom they
      look for orders. Xenophon furnishes him with a splendid outfit of
      heroic qualities, suitable to this ascendant position: and
      represents the foundation of the vast Persian empire, with the
      unshaken fidelity of all the heterogeneous people composing it, as
      the reward of a laborious life spent in the active display of such
      qualities. In his interesting Preface to the Cyrop&aelig;dia, he
      presents this as the solution of a problem which had greatly
      perplexed him. He had witnessed many revolutions in the Grecian
      cities &#8212; subversions of democracies, oligarchies, and despotisms:
      he had seen also private establishments, some with numerous
      servants, some with few, yet scarcely any house-master able to
      obtain hearty or continued obedience. But as to herds of cattle or
      flocks of sheep, on the contrary, he had seen them uniformly
      obedient; suffering the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page224"
          id="v1page224"></a>224</span>herdsman or shepherd to do what
      he pleased with them, and never once conspiring against him. The
      first inference of Xenophon from these facts was, that man was by
      nature the most difficult of all animals to govern.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_53" href="#Footnotev1_4_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a>
      But he became satisfied that he was mistaken, when he reflected on
      the history of Cyrus; who had acquired and maintained dominion
      over more men than had ever been united under one empire, always
      obeying him cheerfully and affectionately. This history proved to
      Xenophon that it was not impossible, nor even difficult,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_54" href="#Footnotev1_4_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
      to rule mankind, provided a man undertook it with scientific or
      artistic competence. Accordingly, he proceeded to examine what
      Cyrus was in birth, disposition, and education &#8212; and how he came
      to be so admirably accomplished in the government of men.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_55" href="#Footnotev1_4_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>
      The result is the Cyrop&aelig;dia. We must observe, however, that
      his solution of the problem is one which does not meet the full
      difficulties. These difficulties, as he states them, had been
      suggested to him by his Hellenic experience: by the instability of
      government in Grecian cities. But the solution which he provides
      departs from Hellenic experience, and implies what Aristotle and
      Hippokrates called the more yielding and servile disposition of
      Asiatics:<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_56" href="#Footnotev1_4_56"><span
          class="sp">56</span></a> for it postulates an hereditary chief
      of heroic or divine lineage, such as was nowhere acknowledged in
      Greece, except at Sparta &#8212; and there, only under restrictions
      which would have rendered the case unfit for Xenophon&#8217;s purpose.
      The heroic and regal lineage of Cyrus was a condition not less
      essential to success than his disposition and education:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_57" href="#Footnotev1_4_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>
      and not merely his lineage, but also the farther fact, that
      besides being constant in the duties of prayer and sacrifice to
      the Gods, he was peculiarly favoured by them with premonitory
      signs and warnings in all difficult emergencies.<a

        problem &#8212; The governing aptitude and popularity of Cyrus come
        from nature, not from education.</span></p>
    <p>The fundamental principle of Xenophon is, that to obtain hearty
      and unshaken obedience is not difficult for a ruler, provided he
      possesses the science or art of ruling. This is a principle
      expressly laid down by Sokrates in the Xenophontic Memorabilia.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_59" href="#Footnotev1_4_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
      We have seen Plato affirming in the Politikus<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_60" href="#Footnotev1_4_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a>
      that this is the only true government, though very few individuals
      are competent to it: Plato gives to it a peculiar application in
      the Republic, and points out a philosophical or dialectic tuition
      whereby he supposes that his Elders will acquire the science or
      art of command. The Cyrop&aelig;dia presents to us an illustrative
      example. Cyrus is a young prince who, from twenty-six years of age
      to his dying day, is always ready with his initiative, provident
      in calculation of consequences, and personally active in
      enforcement: giving the right order at the right moment, with good
      assignable reasons. As a military man, he is not only personally
      forward, but peculiarly dexterous in the marshalling and
      management of soldiers; like the Homeric Agamemnon<a

      spontaneous growth in Cyrus &#8212; a portion of his divine constitution
      or of the golden element in his nature (to speak in the phrase of
      the Platonic Republic): for no means are pointed out whereby he
      acquired it, and the Platonic Sokrates would have asked in vain,
      where teachers of it were to be found. It is true that he is made
      to go through a rigorous and long-continued training: but this
      training is common to him with all the other Persian youths of <span

      family, and is calculated to teach obedience, not to communicate
      aptitude for command; while the master of tactics, whose lessons
      he receives apart, is expressly declared to have known little
      about the duties of a commander.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_62"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> Kambyses
      indeed (father of Cyrus) gives to his son valuable general
      exhortations respecting the multiplicity of exigencies which press
      upon a commander, and the constant watchfulness, precautions,
      fertility of invention, required on his part to meet them. We read
      the like in the conversations of Sokrates in the Memorabilia:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_63" href="#Footnotev1_4_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
      but neither Kambyses nor Sokrates are teachers of the art of
      commanding. For this art, Cyrus is assumed to possess a natural
      aptitude; like the other elements of his dispositions &#8212; his warm
      sympathies, his frank and engaging manners, his ardent emulation
      combined with perfect freedom from jealousy, his courage, his love
      of learning, his willingness to endure any amount of labour for
      the purpose of obtaining praise, &amp;c., all which Xenophon
      represents as belonging to him by nature, together with a very

    <p>The Cyrop&aelig;dia is a title not fairly representing the
      contents of the work, which contains a more copious biography of
      the hero than any which we read in Plutarch or Suetonius. But the
      education of Cyrus<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_65"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> is the
      most remarkable part of it, in which the ethico-political theory
      of Xenophon, generated by Sokratic refining criticism brought to
      bear on the Spartan drill and discipline, is put forth. Professing
      to describe the Persian polity, he in reality describes only the
      Persian education; which is public, and prescribed by law,
      intended to form the character of individuals so that they shall
      stand in no need of coercive laws or penalties. Most cities leave
      the education of youth to be conducted at the discretion of their
      parents, and think it sufficient to enact and enforce laws
      forbidding, under penal sanction, theft, murder, and various other

        education &#8212; Severe discipline &#8212; Distribution of four ages.</span></p>
    <p>There are four categories of age:&#8212;boys, up to sixteen &#8212; young men
      or eph&ecirc;bi, from sixteen to twenty-six &#8212; mature men, as far
      as fifty-one &#8212; above that age, elders. To each of these four
      classes there is assigned a certain portion of the &#8220;free agora&#8221;: <i>i.e.</i>,
      the great square of the city, where no buying or selling or vulgar
      occupation is allowed &#8212; where the regal residence is situated, and
      none but dignified functions, civil or military, are carried on.
      Here the boys and the mature men assemble every day at sunrise,
      continue under drill, and take their meals; while the young men
      even pass the night on guard near the government house. Each of
      the four sections is commanded by superintendents or officers:
      those superintending the boys are Elders, who are employed in
      administering justice to the boys, and in teaching them what
      justice is. They hold judicial trials of the boys for various
      sorts of misconduct: for violence, theft, abusive words, lying,
      and even for ingratitude. In cases of proved guilt, beating or
      flogging is inflicted. The boys go there to learn justice (says
      Xenophon), as boys in Hellas go to school to learn letters. Under
      this discipline, and in learning the use of the bow and javelin
      besides, they spend the time until sixteen years of age. They
      bring their food with them from home (wheaten bread, with a
      condiment of kardamon, or bruised seed of the nasturtium),
      together with a wooden cup to draw water from the river: and they
      dine at public tables under the eye of the teacher. The young men
      perform all the military and police duty under the commands of the
      King and the Elders: moreover, they accompany the King when he
      goes on a hunting expedition &#8212; which accustoms them to fatigue and
      long abstinence, as well as to the encounter of dangerous wild
      animals. The Elders do not take part in these hunts, nor in any
      foreign military march, nor are they bound, like the others, to
      daily attendance in the agora. <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page228" id="v1page228"></a>228</span>They appoint all
      officers, and try judicially the cases shown up by the
      superintendents, or other accusers, of all youths or mature men
      who have failed in the requirements of the public discipline. The
      gravest derelictions they punish with death: where this is not
      called for, they put the offender out of his class, so that he
      remains degraded all his life.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_67"

    <p>This severe discipline is by law open to all Persians who choose
      to attend and the honours of the state are attainable by all
      equally. But in practice it is confined to a few: for neither boys
      nor men can attend it continuously, except such as possess an
      independent maintenance; nor is any one allowed to enter the
      regiment of youths or mature men, unless he has previously gone
      through the discipline of boyhood. The elders, by whom the higher
      functions are exercised, must be persons who have passed without
      reproach through all the three preceding stages: so that these
      offices, though legally open to all, are in practice confined to a
      few &#8212; the small class of Homotimoi.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_68"

    <p>Such is Xenophon&#8217;s conception of a perfect Polity. It consists in
      an effective public discipline and drill, begun in early boyhood
      and continued until old age. The evidence on which he specially
      insists to prove its good results relates first to the body. The
      bodies of the Persians become so dry and hard, that they neither
      spit, nor have occasion to wipe their noses, nor are full of wind,
      nor are ever seen to retire for the satisfaction of natural wants.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_69" href="#Footnotev1_4_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>
      Besides this, the discipline enforces complete habits of
      obedience, sobriety, justice, endurance of pain and privation. </p>

    <p>We may note here both the agreement, and the difference, between
      Xenophon and Plato, as to the tests applied for measuring the
      goodness of their respective disciplinarian schemes. In regard to
      the ethical effects desirable (obedience, sobriety, &amp;c.) both
      were agreed. But while Plato (in Republic) dwells much besides
      upon the musical training necessary, Xenophon omits this, and
      substitutes in its place the working off of all the superfluous
      moisture of the body.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_70"

        Justice-Master.</span></p>
    <p>Through the two youthful stages of this discipline Cyrus is
      represented as having passed; undergoing all the fatigues as well
      as the punishment (he is beaten or flogged by the superintendent<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_71" href="#Footnotev1_4_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>)
      with as much rigour as the rest, and even surpassing all his
      comrades in endurance and exemplary obedience, not less than in
      the bow and the javelin. In the lessons about justice he manifests
      such pre-eminence, that he is appointed by the superintendent to
      administer justice to other boys: and it is in this capacity that
      he is chastised for his well-known decision, awarding the large
      coat to the great boy and the little coat to the little boy, as
      being more convenient to both,<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_72"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a> though
      the proprietorship was opposite: the master impressing upon him,
      as a general explanation, that the lawful or customary was the
      Just.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_73" href="#Footnotev1_4_73"><span
          class="sp">73</span></a> Cyrus had been brought as a boy by
      his mother Mandan&ecirc; to visit her father, the Median king
      Astyages. The boy wins the affection of Astyages and all around by
      his child-like frankness and affectionate sympathy (admirably
      depicted in Xenophon): while he at the same time resists the
      corruptions of a luxurious court, and adheres to the simplicity of
      his Persian training. When Mandan&ecirc; is about to depart and to
      rejoin her husband Kambyses in Persis, she is entreated by
      Astyages to allow Cyrus to remain with him. Cyrus himself also
      desires to remain: but Mandan&ecirc; hesitates to allow it:
      putting to Cyrus, among other difficulties, the question &#8212; How
      will you learn justice here, when the teachers of it are in
      Persis? To which Cyrus replies &#8212; I am already well taught in
      justice: as you may see by the fact, that my teacher made me a
      judge over other boys, and compelled me to render account to him
      of all my proceedings.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_74"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> Besides
      which, if I am found wanting, my grandfather Astyages will make up
      the deficient teaching. But (says Mandan&ecirc;) justice is not
      the same here under Astyages, as it is in Persis. Astyages has
      made himself master of all the Medes: while among the Persians
      equality is accounted justice. Your father Kambyses both performs
      all that the city directs, and receives nothing more <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page230" id="v1page230"></a>230</span>than



      what the city allows: the measure for him is, not his own
      inclination, but the law. You must therefore be cautious of
      staying here, lest you should bring back with you to Persia habits
      of despotism, and of grasping at more than any one else,
      contracted from your grandfather: for if you come back in this
      spirit, you will assuredly be flogged to death. Never fear, mother
      (answered Cyrus): my grandfather teaches every one round him to
      claim less than his due &#8212; not more than his due: and he will teach
      me the same.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_75" href="#Footnotev1_4_75"><span

    <p>The portion of the Cyrop&aelig;dia just cited deserves especial

    <p>Now Xenophon, in his description of the Persian official
      discipline, provides a sufficient answer to the second question &#8212;
      Whether justice is teachable &#8212; and where are the teachers thereof?
      It <i>is</i> teachable: there are official teachers appointed:
      and every boy passes through a course of teaching prolonged for
      several years. &#8212; But Xenophon does not at all recognise the
      Sokratic requirement, that the first question shall be fully
      canvassed and satisfactorily answered, before the second is
      approached. The first question is indeed answered in a certain way
      &#8212; though the answer appears here only as an <i>obiter dictum</i>,
      and is never submitted to any Elenchus at all. The master explains
      &#8212; What is Justice? &#8212; by telling Cyrus, &#8220;That the lawful is just, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page231" id="v1page231"></a>231</span>and



      that the lawless is violent&#8221;. Now if we consider this as
      preceptorial &#8212; as an admonition to the youthful Cyrus how he ought
      to decide judicial cases &#8212; it is perfectly reasonable: &#8220;Let your
      decisions be conformable to the law or custom of the country&#8221;. But
      if we consider it as a portion of philosophy or reasoned truth &#8212;
      as a definition or rational explanation of Justice, advanced by a
      respondent who is bound to defend it against the Sokratic
      cross-examination &#8212; we shall find it altogether insufficient.
      Xenophon himself tells us here, that Law or Custom is one thing
      among the Medes, and the reverse among the Persians: accordingly
      an action which is just in the one place will be unjust in the
      other. It is by objections of this kind that Sokrates, both in
      Plato and Xenophon, refutes explanations propounded by his

      <p>We read in Pascal, Pens&eacute;es, i. 6, 8-9:&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;On ne voit presque rien de juste et d&#8217;injuste, qui ne change
        de qualit&eacute; en changeant de climat. Trois degr&eacute;s
        d&#8217;&eacute;l&eacute;vation du p&ocirc;le renversent toute la
        jurisprudence. Un m&eacute;ridien d&eacute;cide de la
        verit&eacute;: en peu d&#8217;ann&eacute;es de possession, les loix
        fondamentales changent: le droit a ses &eacute;poques. Plaisante
        justice, qu&#8217;une rivi&egrave;re ou une montagne borne!
        V&eacute;rit&eacute; au de&ccedil;&agrave; des
        Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es &#8212; erreur au del&agrave;!</p>
      <p>&#8220;Ils confessent que la justice n&#8217;est pas dans les coutumes,
        mais qu&#8217;elle reside dans les loix naturelles, connues en tout
        pays. Certainement ils la soutiendraient opini&acirc;trement, si
        la t&eacute;m&eacute;rit&eacute; du hasard qui a sem&eacute; les
        loix humaines en avait rencontr&eacute; au moins une qui fut
        universelle: mais la plaisanterie est telle, que le caprice des
        hommes s&#8217;est si bien diversifi&eacute;, qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y en a point. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Le larcin, l&#8217;inceste, le meurtre des enfans et des
        p&egrave;res, tout a eu sa place entre les actions vertueuses.
        Se peut-il rien de plus plaisant, qu&#8217;un homme ait droit de me
        tuer parcequ&#8217;il demeure au-del&agrave; de l&#8217;eau, et que son
        prince a querelle avec le mien, quoique je n&#8217;en aie aucune avec

        l&#8217;autre, la coutume pr&eacute;sente &#8212; et c&#8217;est le plus
        s&ucirc;r. Rien, suivant la seule raison, n&#8217;est juste de soi:
        tout branle avec le temps. La coutume fait toute
        l&#8217;&eacute;quit&eacute;, par cela seul qu&#8217;elle est re&ccedil;ue:
        c&#8217;est le fondement mystique de son autorit&eacute;. Qui la

    <p>Though the explanation of Justice here given is altogether
      untenable, yet we shall find it advanced by Sokrates himself as
      complete and conclusive, in the Xenophontic Memorabilia, where he
      is conversing with the Sophist Hippias. That Sophist is
      represented as at first urging difficulties against it, but
      afterwards as concurring with Sokrates: who enlarges upon the
      definition, and extols it as perfectly satisfactory. If <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page232" id="v1page232"></a>232</span>Sokrates



      really delivered this answer to Hippias, as a general definition
      of Justice &#8212; we may learn from it how much greater was his
      negative acuteness in overthrowing the definitions of others, than
      his affirmative perspicacity in discovering unexceptionable
      definitions of his own. This is the deficiency admitted by himself
      in the Platonic Apology &#8212; lamented by friends like Kleitophon &#8212;
      arraigned by opponents like Hippias and Thrasymachus. Xenophon,
      whose intellect was practical rather than speculative, appears not
      to be aware of it. He does not feel the depth and difficulty of
      the Sokratic problems, even while he himself enunciates them. He
      does not appreciate all the conditions of a good definition,
      capable of being maintained against that formidable
      cross-examination (recounted by himself) whereby Sokrates humbled
      the youth Euthyd&ecirc;mus: still less does he enter into the
      spirit of that Sokratic order of precedence (declared in the
      negative Platonic dialogues), in the study of philosophical
      questions:&#8212;First define Justice, and find a definition of it such
      as you can maintain against a cross-examining adversary before you
      proceed either to affirm or deny any predicates concerning it. The
      practical advice and reflexions of Xenophon are, for the most
      part, judicious and penetrating. But he falls very short when he
      comes to deal with philosophical theory:&#8212;with reasoned truth, and
      with the Sokratic Elenchus as a test for discriminating such truth
      from the false, the doubtful, or the not-proven. </p>

    <p>Cyrus is allowed by his mother to remain amidst the luxuries of
      the Median court. It is a part of his admirable disposition that
      he resists all its temptations,<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_79"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> and goes
      back to the hard fare and discipline of the Persians with the same
      exemplary obedience as before. He is appointed by the Elders to
      command the Persian contingent which is sent to assist Kyaxares
      (son of Astyages), king of Media; and he thus enters upon that
      active military career which is described as occupying his whole
      life, until his conquest of Babylon, and his subsequent
      organization of the great Persian empire. His father Kambyses
      sends him forth with excellent exhortations, many of which are
      almost in the same words as those which we read <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page233" id="v1page233"></a>233</span>ascribed



      to Sokrates in the Memorabilia. In the details of Cyrus&#8217;s
      biography which follow, the stamp of Sokratic influence is less
      marked, yet seldom altogether wanting. The conversation of
      Sokrates had taught Xenophon how to make the most of his own large
      experience and observation. His biography of Cyrus represents a
      string of successive situations, calling forth and displaying the
      aptitude of the hero for command. The epical invention with which
      these situations are imagined &#8212; the variety of characters
      introduced, Araspes, Abradates, Pantheia, Chrysantas, Hystaspes,
      Gadatas, Gobryas, Tigranes, &amp;c. &#8212; the dramatic propriety with
      which each of these persons is animated as speaker, and made to
      teach a lesson bearing on the predetermined conclusion &#8212; all these
      are highly honourable to the Xenophontic genius, but all of them
      likewise bespeak the Companion of Sokrates. Xenophon dwells, with
      evident pleasure, on the details connected with the <i>rationale</i>
      of military proceedings: the wants and liabilities of soldiers,
      the advantages or disadvantages of different weapons or different
      modes of marshalling, the duties of the general as compared with
      those of the soldier, &amp;c. Cyrus is not merely always ready
      with his orders, but also competent as a speaker to explain the
      propriety of what he orders.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_80"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> We have
      the truly Athenian idea, that persuasive speech is the precursor
      of intelligent and energetic action: and that it is an attribute
      essentially necessary for a general, for the purpose of informing,
      appeasing, re-assuring, the minds of the soldiers.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_81" href="#Footnotev1_4_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
      This, as well as other duties and functions of a military
      commander, we find laid down generally in the conversations of
      Sokrates,<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_82" href="#Footnotev1_4_82"><span
          class="sp">82</span></a> who conceives these functions, in
      their most general aspect, as a branch of the comprehensive art of
      guiding or governing men. What Sokrates thus enunciates generally,
      is exemplified in detail throughout the life of Cyrus. </p>

    <p>This last remark may also be made respecting the concluding
      proceedings of Cyrus, after he has thoroughly completed his
      conquests, and when he establishes arrangements for governing them
      permanently. The scheme of government which Xenophon imagines and
      introduces him as organizing, is neither Sokratic nor Platonic,
      nor even Hellenic: it would probably have been as little
      acceptable to his friend Agesilaus, the marked &#8220;hater of Persia,&#8221;<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_85" href="#Footnotev1_4_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a>
      as to any Athenian politician. It is altogether an Oriental
      despotism, skilfully organized both for the security of the despot
      and for enabling him to keep a vigorous hold on subjects distant
      as well as near: such as the younger Cyrus might possibly have
      attempted, if his brother Artaxerxes had been slain at Kunaxa,
      instead of himself. &#8220;Eam conditionem esse imperandi, ut non aliter
      ratio constet, quam si uni reddatur&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_86"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> &#8212; is a
      maxim repugnant to Hellenic ideas, and not likely to be rendered
      welcome even by the regulations of <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page235" id="v1page235"></a>235</span>detail with
      which Xenophon surrounds it; judicious as these regulations are
      for their contemplated purpose. The amiable and popular character
      which Cyrus has maintained from youth upwards, and by means of
      which he has gained an uninterrupted series of victories, is
      difficult to be reconciled with the insecurity, however imposing,
      in which he dwells as Great King. When we find that he accounts it
      a necessary precaution to surround himself with eunuchs, on the
      express ground that they are despised by every one else and
      therefore likely to be more faithful to their master &#8212; when we
      read also that in consequence of the number of disaffected
      subjects, he is forced to keep a guard composed of twenty thousand
      soldiers taken from poor Persian mountaineers<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_87" href="#Footnotev1_4_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a>
      &#8212; we find realised, in the case of the triumphant Cyrus, much of
      that peril and insecurity which the despot Hieron had so bitterly
      deplored in his conversation with Simonides. However
      unsatisfactory the ideal of government may be, which Plato lays
      out either in the Republic or the Leges &mdash; that which Xenophon sets
      before us is not at all more acceptable, in spite of the splendid
      individual portrait whereby he dazzles our imagination. Few
      Athenians would have exchanged Athens either for Babylon under
      Cyrus, or for Plato&#8217;s Magn&ecirc;tic colony in Krete. </p>

    <p>The Xenophontic government is thus noway admirable, even as an

      nothing but vice, corruption, degeneracy of every kind, exorbitant
      sensuality, faithlessness and cowardice.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_88"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> His
      picture of Persia is like that of the of Platonic Kosmos, which we
      can read in the Tim&aelig;us:<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_89"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> a
      splendid Kosmos in its original plan and construction, but full of
      defects and evil as it actually exists. The strength and
      excellence of the Xenophontic orderly despotism dies with its
      heroic beginner. His two sons (as Plato remarked) do not receive
      the same elaborate <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page236"
          id="v1page236"></a>236</span>training and discipline as
      himself: nor can they be restrained, even by the impressive appeal
      which he makes to them on his death-bed, from violent dissension
      among themselves, and misgovernment of every kind.<a

        military and equestrian proceedings &#8212; No experience of finance
        and commerce.</span></p>
    <p>Whatever we may think of the political ideal of Xenophon, his
      Cyrop&aelig;dia is among the glories of the Sokratic family; as an
      excellent specimen of the philosophical imagination, in carrying a
      general doctrine into illustrative details &#8212; and of the epical
      imagination in respect to varied characters and touching incident.
      In stringing together instructive conversations, moreover, it
      displays the same art which we trace in the Memorabilia,
      &#338;konomikus, Hieron, &amp;c., and which is worthy of the attentive
      companion of Sokrates. Whenever Xenophon talks about military
      affairs, horsemanship, agriculture, house-management, &amp;c., he
      is within the range of personal experience of his own; and his
      recommendations, controlled as they thus are by known realities,
      are for the most part instructive and valuable. Such is the case
      not merely with the Cyrop&aelig;dia and &#338;konomikus, but also in
      his two short treatises, De Re Equestri and De Officio Magistri
      Equitum. </p>
    <p>But we cannot say so much when he discusses plans of finance. </p>

        finance and the condition of Athens. His admiration of active
        commerce and variety of pursuits.</span></p>
    <p>We read among his works a discourse composed after his sentence
      of exile had been repealed, and when he was very old, seemingly
      not earlier than 355 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_91" href="#Footnotev1_4_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
      &#8212; criticising the actual condition of Athens, and proposing
      various measures for the improvement of the finances, as well as
      for relief of the citizens from poverty. He begins this discourse
      by a sentiment thoroughly Sokratic and Platonic, which would serve
      almost as a continuation of the Cyrop&aelig;dia. The government of
      a city will be measured by the character and ability of its
      leaders.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_92" href="#Footnotev1_4_92"><span
          class="sp">92</span></a> He closes it by another sentiment
      equally Sokratic and Platonic; advising that <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page237" id="v1page237"></a>237</span>before



      his measures are adopted, special messengers shall be sent to
      Delphi and Dodona; to ascertain whether the Gods approve them &#8212;
      and if they approve, to which Gods they enjoin that the initiatory
      sacrifices shall be offered.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_93"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a> But
      almost everything in the discourse, between the first and last
      sentences, is in a vein not at all Sokratic &#8212; in a vein, indeed,
      positively anti-Platonic and anti-Spartan. We have already seen
      that wealth, gold and silver, commerce, influx of strangers,
      &amp;c., are discouraged as much as possible by Plato, and by the
      theory (though evaded partially in practice) of Sparta. Now it is
      precisely these objects which Xenophon, in the treatise before us,
      does his utmost to foster and extend at Athens. Nothing is here
      said about the vulgarising influence of trade as compared with
      farming, which we read in the &#338;konomikus: nor about the ethical
      and p&aelig;dagogic dictation which pervades so much of the
      Cyrop&aelig;dia, and reigns paramount throughout the Platonic
      Republic and Leges. Xenophon takes Athens as she stands, with
      great variety of tastes, active occupation, and condition among
      the inhabitants: her mild climate and productive territory,
      especially her veins of silver and her fine marble: her importing
      and exporting merchants, her central situation, as convenient
      entrep&ocirc;t for commodities produced in the most distant lands:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_4_94" href="#Footnotev1_4_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a>
      her skilful artisans and craftsmen: her monied capitalists: and
      not these alone, but also the congregation and affluence of fine
      artists, intellectual men, philosophers, Sophists, poets,
      rhapsodes, actors, &amp;c.: last, though not least, the temples
      adorning her akropolis, and the dramatic representations exhibited
      at her Dionysiac festivals, which afforded the highest captivation
      to eye as well as ear, and attracted strangers from all quarters
      as visitors.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_95" href="#Footnotev1_4_95"><span
          class="sp">95</span></a> Xenophon extols these charms of
      Athens with a warmth which reminds us of the Periklean funeral
      oration in Thucydides.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_96"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> He no
      longer speaks like one whose heart and affections are with the
      Spartan <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page238" id="v1page238"></a>238</span>drill:



      still less does he speak like Plato &#8212; to whom (as we see both by
      the Republic and the Leges) such artistic and poetical exhibitions
      were abominations calling for censorial repression &#8212; and in whose
      eyes gold, silver, commerce, abundant influx of strangers,
      &amp;c., were dangerous enemies of all civic virtue. </p>

        Metics. How these may be encouraged.</span></p>
    <p>First, he dwells upon the great advantage of encouraging metics,
      or foreigners resident at Athens, each of whom paid an annual
      capitation tax to the treasury. There were already many such, not
      merely Greeks, but Orientals also, Lydians, Phrygians, Syrians,
      &amp;c.:<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_98" href="#Footnotev1_4_98"><span
          class="sp">98</span></a> and by judicious encouragement all
      expatriated men everywhere might be made to prefer the agreeable
      residence at Athens, thus largely increasing the annual amount of
      the tax. The metics ought (he says) to be exempted from military
      service (which the citizens ought to perform and might perform
      alone), but to be admitted to the honours of the equestrian duty,
      whenever they were rich enough to afford it: and farther, to be
      allowed the liberty of purchasing land and building houses in the
      city. Moreover not merely resident metics, but also foreign
      merchants who came as visitors, conducting an extensive commerce &#8212;
      ought to be flattered by complimentary votes and occasional
      hospitalities: while the curators of the harbour, whose function
      it was to settle disputes among them, should receive prizes if
      they adjudicated equitably and speedily.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_99"

        Distribution of three oboli per head per day to all the
        citizens.</span></p>
    <p>All this (Xenophon observes) will require only friendly and
      considerate demonstrations. His farther schemes are more
      ambitious, not to be effected without a large outlay. He proposes
      to raise an ample fund for the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page239" id="v1page239"></a>239</span>purposes of the
      city, by voluntary contributions; which he expects to obtain not
      merely from private Athenians and metics, rich and in easy
      circumstances &#8212; but also from other cities, and even from foreign
      despots, kings, satraps, &amp;c. The tempting inducement will be,
      that the names of all contributors with their respecting
      contributions will be inscribed on public tablets, and permanently
      commemorated as benefactors of the city.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_100"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a>
      Contributors (he says) are found, for the outfit of a fleet, where
      they expect no return: much more will they come forward here,
      where a good return will accrue. The fund so raised will be
      employed under public authority with the most profitable result,
      in many different ways. The city will build docks and warehouses
      for bonding goods &#8212; houses near the harbour to be let to merchants
      &#8212; merchant-vessels to be let out on freight. But the largest
      profit will be obtained by working the silver mines at Laureion in
      Attica. The city will purchase a number of foreign slaves, and
      will employ them under the superintendence of old free citizens
      who are past the age of labour, partly in working these mines for
      public account, each of the ten tribes employing one tenth part of
      the number &#8212; partly by letting them out to private mining
      undertakers, at so much per diem for each slave: the slaves being
      distinguished by a conspicuous public stamp, and the undertaker
      binding himself under penalty always to restore the same number of
      them as he received.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_101"
        href="#Footnotev1_4_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a> Such
      competition between the city and the private mining undertakers
      will augment the total produce, and will be no loss to either, but
      wholesome for both. The mines will absorb as many workmen as are
      put into them: for in the production of silver (Xenophon argues)
      there can never be any glut, as there is sometimes in corn, wine,
      or oil. Silver is always in demand, and is not lessened in value
      by increase of quantity. Every one is anxious to get it, and has
      as much pleasure in hoarding it under ground as in actively
      employing it.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_102" href="#Footnotev1_4_102"><span
          class="sp">102</span></a> The scheme, thus described, may (if
      found necessary) be brought into operation by degrees, a certain
      number of slaves being purchased annually until the full total is
      made up. From these various financial projects, and <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page240" id="v1page240"></a>240</span>especially



      from the fund thus employed as capital under the management of the
      Senate, the largest returns are expected. Amidst the general
      abundance which will ensue, the religious festivals will be
      celebrated with increased splendour &#8212; the temples will be
      repaired, the docks and walls will be put in complete order &#8212; the
      priests, the Senate, the magistrates, the horsemen, will receive
      the full stipends which the old custom of Athens destined for
      them.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_103" href="#Footnotev1_4_103"><span
          class="sp">103</span></a> But besides all these, the object
      which Xenophon has most at heart will be accomplished: the poor
      citizens will be rescued from poverty. There will be a regular
      distribution among all citizens, per head and equally. Three
      oboli, or half a drachma, will be allotted daily to each, to poor
      and rich alike. For the poor citizens, this will provide a
      comfortable subsistence, without any contribution on their part:
      the poverty now prevailing will thus be alleviated. The rich, like
      the poor, receive the daily triobolon as a free gift: but if they
      even compute it as interest for their investments, they will find
      that the rate of interest is full and satisfactory, like the rate
      on bottomry. Three oboli per day amount in the year of 360 days to
      180 drachm&aelig;: now if a rich man has contributed ten
      min&aelig; ( = 1000 drachm&aelig;), he will thus receive interest
      at the rate of 18 per cent. per annum: if another less rich
      citizen has contributed one mina ( = 100 drachm&aelig;), he will
      receive interest at the rate of 180 per cent. per annum: more than
      he could realise in any other investment.<a

    <p>Half a drachma, or three oboli, per day, was the highest rate of
      pay ever received (the rate varied at different times) by the
      citizens as Dikasts and Ekklesiasts, for attending in judicature
      or in assembly. It is this amount of pay which Xenophon here
      proposes to ensure to every citizen, without exception, out of the
      public treasury; which (he calculates) would be enriched by his
      project so as easily to bear such a disbursement. He relieves the
      poor citizens from poverty by making them all pensioners on the
      public treasury, with or <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page241" id="v1page241"></a>241</span>without service
      rendered, or the pretence of service. He strains yet farther the
      dangerous principle of the The&ocirc;rikon, without the same
      excuse as can be shown for the The&ocirc;rikon itself on religious
      grounds.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_105" href="#Footnotev1_4_105"><span

      been dwelt upon by most historians of Greece as an illustration of
      the cacoethes of democracy &#8212; to extract money, somehow or other,
      from the rich, for the purpose of keeping the poor in comfort. Not
      one of the democratical leaders, so far as we know, ever ventured
      to propose so sweeping a measure: we have it here from the pen of
      the oligarchical Xenophon.</p>

        financial and commercial.</span></p>
    <p>But we must of course discuss Xenophon&#8217;s scheme as a whole: the
      aggregate enlargement of revenue, from his various visionary new
      ways and means, on one side &#8212; against the new mode and increased
      amount of expenditure, on the other side. He would not have
      proposed such an expenditure, if he had not thoroughly believed in
      the correctness of his own anticipations, both as to the profits
      of the mining scheme, and as to the increase of receipts from
      other sources: such as the multiplication of tax-paying Metics,
      the rent paid by them for the new houses to be built by the city,
      the increase of the harbour dues from expanded foreign trade. But
      of these anticipations, even the least unpromising are vague and
      uncertain: while the prospects of the mining scheme appear
      thoroughly chimerical. Nothing is clear or certain except the
      disbursement. We scarcely understand how Xenophon could seriously
      have imagined, either that voluntary contributors could have been
      found to subscribe the aggregate fund as he proposes &#8212; or that, if
      subscribed, it could have yielded the prodigious return upon which
      he reckons. We must, however, recollect that he had no familiarity
      with finance, or with the conditions and liabilities of commerce,
      or with the raising of money from voluntary contributors for any
      collective purpose. He would not have indulged in similar fancies
      if the question had been about getting together supplies for an
      army. Practical Athenian financiers would probably say, in
      criticising his financial project &#8212; what <span class="pagenum"><a

        This passage of Heraldus is cited by M. Boeckh in his Public
        Economy of Athens, B. iv. ch. 21, p. 606, Eng. Trans. In that
        chapter of M. Boeckh&#8217;s work (pp. 600-610) some very instructive
        pages will be found about the Xenophontic scheme here noticed. </p>
      <p>I will however mention one or two points on which my
        understanding of the scheme differs from his. He says (p.
        605):&#8212;&#8220;The author supposes that the profit upon this speculation
        would amount to three oboli per day, so that the subscribers
        would obtain a very high per centage on their shares. Xenophon
        supposes unequal contributions, according to the different
        amounts of property, agreeable to the principles of a
        property-tax, but an equal distribution of the receipts for the
        purpose of favouring and aiding the poor. What Xenophon is
        speaking of is an income annually arising upon each share,
        either equal to or exceeding the interest of the loans on
        bottomry. Where, however, is the security that the undertaking
        would produce three oboli a day to each subscriber?&#8221; </p>
      <p>I concur in most of what is here said; but M. Boeckh states the
        matter too much as if the three oboli per diem were a real
        return arising from the scheme, and payable to each shareholder
        upon each <i>share</i> as he calls it. This is an accident of
        the case, not the essential feature. The poorest citizens &#8212; for
        whose benefit, more than for any other object, the scheme is
        contrived &#8212; would not be shareholders at all: they would be too
        poor to contribute anything, yet each of them would receive his
        triobolon like the rest. Moreover, many citizens, even though
        able to pay, might hold back, and decline to pay: yet still each
        would receive as much. And again, the foreigners, kings,
        satraps, &amp;c., would be contributors, but would receive
        nothing at all. The distribution of the triobolon would be made
        to citizens only. Xenophon does indeed state the proportion of
        receipt to payments in the cases of some rich contributors, as
        an auxiliary motive to conciliate them. But we ought not to
        treat this receipt as if it were a real return yielded by the
        public mining speculation, or as profit actually brought in. </p>
      <p>As I conceive the scheme, the daily triobolon, and the
        respective contributions furnished, have no premeditated ratio,
        no essential connection with each other. The daily payment of
        the triobolon to every citizen indiscriminately, is a new and
        heavy burden which Xenophon imposes upon the city. But this is
        only one among many other burdens, as we may see by cap. 6. In
        order to augment the wealth of the city, so as to defray these
        large expenses, he proposes several new financial measures. Of
        these the most considerable was the public mining speculation;
        but it did not stand alone. The financial scheme of Xenophon,
        both as to receipts and as to expenditure, is more general than
        M. Boeckh allows for.</p>

      <p>Hume has been misled by dwelling upon one or two separate
        sentences. If he had taken into consideration the whole
        discourse and its declared scope, he would have seen that it
        affords no warrant for any inference as to the rate of interest
        paid by the Athenian public when they wanted to borrow. In
        Xenophon&#8217;s scheme there is no fixed proportion between what a
        contributor to the fund would pay and what he would receive. The
        triobolon received is a fixed sum to each citizen, whereas the
        contributions of <i>each</i> would be different. Moreover the
        foreigners and metics would contribute without receiving
        anything, while the poor citizens would receive their triobolon
        per head, without having contributed anything.</p>

    <p>Xenophon accompanies his financial scheme with a strong
      recommendation to his countrymen that they should abstain from
      warlike enterprises and maintain peace with every one. He
      expatiates on the manifest advantages, nay, even on the necessity,
      of continued peace, under the actual poverty of the city: for the
      purpose of recruiting the exhausted means of the citizens, as well
      as of favouring his own new projects for the improvement of
      finance and commerce. While he especially deprecates any attempt
      on the part of Athens to regain by force her lost headship over
      the Greeks, he at the same time holds out hopes that this dignity
      would be spontaneously tendered to her, if, besides abstaining
      from all violence, she conducted herself with a liberal and
      conciliatory spirit towards all: if she did her best to adjust

      and politic. Athens had just then concluded peace (355 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>) after the three years of ruinous and
      unsuccessful war, called the Social War, carried on against her
      revolted allies Chios, Kos, Rhodes, and Byzantium. To attempt the
      recovery of empire by force was most mischievous. There was indeed
      one purpose, for which she was called upon by a wise forecast to
      put forth her strength &#8212; to check the aggrandisement of Philip in
      Macedonia. But this was a distant purpose: and the necessity,
      though it became every year more urgent, was not <span

      <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> as to affect the judgment of
      Xenophon. At that early day, Demosthenes himself did not see the
      danger from Macedonia: his first Philippic was delivered in 351 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and even then his remonstrances,
      highly creditable to his own forecast, made little impression on
      others. But when we read the financial oration De Symmoriis we
      appreciate his sound administrative and practical judgment;
      compared with the benevolent dreams and ample public largess in
      which Xenophon here indulges.<a name="FnAnchorv1_4_111"

          id="Sidenotev1_4_41"></a>Difference of the latest compositions
        of Xenophon and Plato, from their point of view in the earlier.</span></p>
    <p>We have seen that Plato died in 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
      having reached the full age of eighty: Xenophon must have attained
      the same age nearly, and may perhaps have attained it completely &#8212;
      though we do not know the exact year of his death. With both these
      two illustrious companions of Sokrates, the point of view is
      considerably modified in their last compositions as compared to
      their earlier. Xenophon shows the alteration not less clearly than
      Plato, though in an opposite direction. His discourse on the
      Athenian revenues differs quite as much from the Anabasis,
      Cyrop&aelig;dia, and &#338;konomikus &#8212; as the Leges and Epinomis differ
      from any of Plato&#8217;s earlier works. Whatever we may think of the
      financial and commercial anticipations of Xenophon, his pamphlet
      on the Athenian revenues betokens a warm sympathy for his native
      city &#8212; a genuine appreciation of her individual freedom and her
      many-sided intellectual activity &#8212; an earnest interest in her
      actual career, and even in the extension of her commercial and
      manufacturing wealth. In these respects it recommends itself to
      our feelings more than the last Platonic production &#8212; Leges and
      Epinomis &#8212; composed nearly at the same time, between 356-347 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> While Xenophon in old age, becoming
      reconciled to his country, forgets his early passion for the
      Spartan drill and discipline, perpetual, monotonous, unlettered &#8212;
      we find in the senility of Plato a more cramping limitation of the
      varieties of human agency &#8212; a stricter compression,<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page245" id="v1page245"></a>245</span>
      even of individual thought and speech, under the infallible
      official orthodoxy &#8212; a more extensive use of the p&aelig;dagogic
      rod and the censorial muzzle than he had ever proposed before. </p>
    <p>In thus taking an unwilling leave of the Sokratic family,
      represented by these two venerable survivors &#8212; to both of whom the
      students of Athenian letters and philosophy are so deeply indebted
      &#8212; I feel some satisfaction in the belief, that both of them died,
      as they were born, citizens of free Athens and of unconquered
      Hellas: and that neither of them was preserved to an excessive old
      age, like their contemporary Isokrates, to witness the extinction
      of Hellenic autonomy by the battle of Ch&aelig;roneia.<a

        Diogen. Laert. iv. 1. The person to whom Diogenes addressed his
        biography of Plato was a female: possibly the wife of the
        emperor Septimius Severus (see Philostr. Vit. Apoll. i. 3), who
        greatly loved and valued the Platonic philosophy (Diog. Laert.
        iii. 47). M&eacute;nage (in his commentary on the Pro&#339;mium)
        supposes the person signified to be Arria: this also is a mere
        conjecture, and in my judgment less probable. We know that the
        empress gave positive encouragement to writers on philosophy.
        The article devoted by Diogenes to Plato is of considerable
        length, including both biography and exposition of doctrine. He
        makes reference to numerous witnesses &#8212; Speusippus, Aristotle,
        Hermod&ocirc;rus, Aristippus, Dik&aelig;archus, Aristoxenus,
        Klearchus, Herakleides, Theopompus, Timon in his Silli or
        satirical poem, Pamphila, Hermippus, Neanthes, Antileon,
        Favorinus, Athenod&ocirc;rus. Timotheus, Idomeneus, Alexander &#7952;&#957;

        Euphorion, Pan&aelig;tius, Myronianus, Polemon, Aristophanes of
        Byzantium, the Alexandrine critic, Antigonus of Karystus,
        Thrasyllus, &amp;c. </p>
      <p>Of the other biographers of Plato, Olympiodorus and the Auctor
        Anonymus cite no authorities. Apuleius, in his survey of the
        doctrine of Plato (De Habitudine doctrinarum Platonis, init. p.
        567, ed. Paris), mentions only Speusippus, as having attested
        the early diligence and quick apprehension of Plato.
        &#8220;Speusippus, domesticis instructus documentis, et pueri ejus
        acre in percipiendo ingenium, et admirand&aelig;
        verecundi&aelig; indolem laudat, et pubescentis primitias labore
        atque amore studendi imbutas refert,&#8221; &amp;c. </p>
      <p>Speusippus had composed a funeral Discourse or Encomium on
        Plato (Diogen. iii. 1, 2; iv. 1, 11). Unfortunately Diogenes
        refers to it only once in reference to Plato. We can hardly make
        out whether any of the authors, whom he cites, had made the life
        of Plato a subject of attentive study. Hermod&ocirc;rus is cited
        by Simplikius as having written a treatise &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;.
        Aristoxenus, Dik&aelig;archus, and Theopompus &#8212; perhaps also
        Hermippus, and Klearchus &#8212; had good means of information. </p>

    <p>Plato was born in &AElig;gina (in which island his father enjoyed

      Thargelion (May) of the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 427.<a

      His family, belonging to the D&ecirc;me Kollytus, was both ancient
      and noble, in the sense attached to that word at Athens. He was
      son of Ariston (or, according to some admirers, of the God Apollo)
      and Periktion&ecirc;: his maternal ancestors had been intimate
      friends or relatives of the law-giver Solon, while his father
      belonged to a Gens tracing its descent from Kodrus, and even from
      the God Poseidon. He was also nearly related to Charmides and to
      Kritias &#8212; this last the well-known and violent leader among the
      oligarchy called the Thirty Tyrants.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_4"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Plato was
      first called Aristokl&ecirc;s, after his grandfather; but received
      when he grew up the name of Plato &#8212; on account of the breadth (we
      are <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page248" id="v1page248"></a>248</span>told)



      either of his forehead or of his shoulders. Endowed with a robust
      physical frame, and exercised in gymnastics, not merely in one of
      the pal&aelig;str&aelig; of Athens (which he describes graphically
      in the Charmides) but also under an Argeian trainer, he attained
      such force and skill as to contend (if we may credit
      Dik&aelig;archus) for the prize of wrestling among boys at the
      Isthmian festival.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_5" href="#Footnotev1_5_5"><span
          class="sp">5</span></a> His literary training was commenced
      under a schoolmaster named Dionysius, and pursued under Drakon, a
      celebrated teacher of music in the large sense then attached to
      that word. He is said to have displayed both diligence and
      remarkable quickness of apprehension, combined too with the utmost
      gravity and modesty.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_6"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> He not only
      acquired great familiarity with the poets, but composed poetry of
      his own &#8212; dithyrambic, lyric, and tragic: and he is even reported
      to have prepared a tragic tetralogy, with the view of competing
      for victory at the Dionysian festival. We are told that he burned
      these poems, when he attached himself to the society of Sokrates.
      No compositions in verse remain under his name, except a few
      epigrams &#8212; amatory, affectionate, and of great poetical beauty.
      But there is ample proof in his dialogues that the cast of his
      mind was essentially poetical. Many of his philosophical
      speculations are nearly allied to poetry, and acquire their hold
      upon the mind rather through imagination and sentiment than
      through reason or evidence. </p>

        It was affirmed distinctly by Hermod&ocirc;rus (according to the
        statement of Diogenes Laertius, iii. 6) that Plato was
        twenty-eight years old at the time of the death of Sokrates:
        that is, in May, 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Zeller,
        Phil. der Griech. vol. ii. p. 39, ed. 2nd.) This would place the
        birth of Plato in 427 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Other
        critics refer his birth to 428 or 429: but I agree with Zeller
        in thinking that the deposition of Hermod&ocirc;rus is more
        trustworthy than any other evidence before us. </p>
      <p>Hermod&ocirc;rus was a friend and disciple of Plato, and is
        even said to have made money by publishing Plato&#8217;s dialogues
        without permission (Cic., Epist. ad Attic. xiii. 21). Suidas,
        &#7961;&#961;&#956;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#962;. He was also an author: he published a treatise &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
        &#924;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; (Diog. L., Pro&#339;m. 2).</p>
      <p>See the more recent Dissertation of Zeller, De Hermodoro
        Ephesio et Hermodoro Platonico, Marburg, 1859, p. 19 seq. He
        cites two important passages (out of the commentary of
        Simplikius on Aristot. Physic.) referring to the work of
        Hermod&ocirc;rus &#8001; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7957;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#8212; a work &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;, on

        The statements respecting Plato&#8217;s relatives are obscure and
        perplexing: unfortunately the <i>domestica documenta</i>, which
        were within the knowledge of his nephew Speusippus, are no
        longer accessible to us. It is certain that he had two brothers,
        Glaukon and Adeimantus: besides which, it would appear from the
        Parmenides (126 B) that he had a younger half-brother by the
        mother&#8217;s side, named Antiphon, and son of Pyrilampes (compare
        Charmides, p. 158 A, and Plut., De Frat. Amore, 12, p. 484 E).
        But the age, which this would assign to Antiphon, does not
        harmonise well with the chronological postulates assumed in the
        exordium of the Parmenides. Accordingly, K. F. Hermann and
        Stallbaum are led to believe, that besides the brothers of Plato
        named Glaukon and Adeimantus, there must also have been two
        uncles of Plato bearing these same names, and having Antiphon
        for their younger brother. (See Stallbaum&#8217;s Prolegg. ad Charm.
        pp. 84, 85, and Prolegg. ad Parmen., Part iii. pp. 304-307.)
        This is not unlikely: but we cannot certainly determine the
        point &#8212; more especially as we do not know what amount of
        chronological inaccuracy Plato might hold to be admissible in
        the <i>personnel</i> of his dialogues.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning, that in the discourse of Andokides de
        Mysteriis, persons named Plato, Charmides, Antiphon, are named
        among those accused of concern in the sacrileges of 415 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> &#8212; the mutilation of the Herm&aelig;
        and the mock celebration of the mysteries. Speusippus is also
        named as among the Senators of the year (Andokides de Myst. p.
        13-27, seq.). Whether these persons belonged to the same family
        as the philosopher Plato, we cannot say. He himself was then
        only twelve years old.</p>

        Xen. Mem. iii. 6, 1. Sokrates was induced by his friendship for
        Plato and for Charmides the cousin of Plato, to admonish the
        forward youth Glaukon (Plato&#8217;s younger brother), who thrust
        himself forward obtrusively to speak in the public assembly
        before he was twenty years of age. The two discourses of
        Sokrates &#8212; one with the presumptuous Glaukon, the other with the
        diffident Charmides &#8212; are both reported by Xenophon. </p>
      <p>These discourses must have taken place before the battle of
        &AElig;gospotami: for Charmides was killed during the Anarchy,
        and Glaukon certainly would never have attempted such acts of
        presumption after the restoration of the democracy, at a time
        when the tide of public feeling had become vehemently hostile to
        Kritias, Charmides, and all the names and families connected
        with the oligarchical rule just overthrown.</p>
      <p>I presume the conversation of Sokrates with Glaukon to have
        taken place in 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> or 405 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>: it was in 405 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        that the disastrous battle of &AElig;gospotami occurred.</p>

        and soldier.</span></p>
    <p>But though Plato may have commenced at the age of twenty his
      acquaintance with Sokrates, he cannot have been exclusively
      occupied in philosophical pursuits between the nineteenth and the
      twenty-fifth year of his age &#8212; that is, between 409-403 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> He was carried, partly by his own
      dispositions, to other matters besides philosophy; and even if
      such dispositions had not existed, the exigencies of the time
      pressed upon him imperatively as an Athenian citizen. Even under
      ordinary circumstances, a young Athenian of eighteen years of age,
      as soon as he was enrolled on the public register of citizens, was
      required to take the memorable military oath in the chapel of
      Aglaurus, and to serve on active duty, constant or nearly
      constant, for two years, in various posts throughout Attica, for
      the defence of the country.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_9"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> But the six
      years from 409-403 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> were years of
      an extraordinary character. They included the most strenuous
      public efforts, the severest suffering, and the gravest political
      revolution, that had ever occurred at Athens. Every Athenian
      citizen was of necessity put upon constant (almost daily) military
      service; either abroad, or in Attica against the
      Laced&aelig;monian garrison established in the permanent fortified
      post of Dekeleia, within sight of the Athenian Akropolis. So <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page250" id="v1page250"></a>250</span>habitually



      were the citizens obliged to be on guard, that Athens, according
      to Thucydides,<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_10" href="#Footnotev1_5_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> became a military post rather than a
      city. It is probable that Plato, by his family and its place on
      the census, belonged to the Athenian Hippeis or Horsemen, who were
      in constant employment for the defence of the territory. But at
      any rate, either on horseback, or on foot, or on shipboard, a
      robust young citizen like Plato, whose military age commenced in
      409, must have borne his fair share in this hard but indispensable
      duty. In the desperate emergency, which preceded the battle of
      Arginus&aelig; (406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), the
      Athenians put to sea in thirty days a fleet of 110 triremes for
      the relief of Mitylen&ecirc;; all the men of military age,
      freemen, and slaves, embarking.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_11"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> We can
      hardly imagine that at such a season Plato can have wished to
      decline service: even if he had wished it, the Strategi would not
      have permitted him. Assuming that he remained at home, the
      garrison-duty at Athens must have been doubled on account of the
      number of departures. After the crushing defeat of the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page251" id="v1page251"></a>251</span>Athenians



      at &AElig;gospotami, came the terrible apprehension at Athens,
      then the long blockade and famine of the city (wherein many died
      of hunger); next the tyranny of the Thirty, who among their other
      oppressions made war upon all free speech, and silenced even the
      voice of Sokrates: then the gallant combat of Thrasybulus followed
      by the intervention of the Laced&aelig;monians &#8212; contingencies
      full of uncertainty and terror, but ending in the restoration of
      the democracy. After such restoration, there followed all the
      anxieties, perils, of reaction, new enactments and provisions,
      required for the revived democracy, during the four years between
      the expulsion of the Thirty and the death of Sokrates.</p>

        &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943;. In one of the anecdotes given by Diogenes (iii. 24)
        Plato alludes to his own military service. Aristoxenus (Diog. L.
        iii. 8) said that Plato had been engaged thrice in military
        expeditions out of Attica: once to Tanagra, a second time to
        Corinth, a third time to Delium, where he distinguished himself.
        Aristoxenus must have had fair means of information, yet I do
        not know what to make of this statement. All the three places
        named are notorious for battles fought by Athens; nevertheless
        chronology utterly forbids the supposition that Plato could have
        been present either at <i>the</i> battle of Tanagra or at <i>the</i>
        battle of Delium. At the battle of Delium Sokrates was present,
        and is said to have distinguished himself: hence there is ground
        for suspecting some confusion between his name and that of
        Plato. It is however possible that there may have been, during
        the interval between 410-405 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
        partial invasions of the frontiers of B&#339;otia by Athenian
        detachments: both Tanagra and Delium were on the B&#339;otian
        frontier. The great battle of Corinth took place in 394 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> Plato left Athens immediately after
        the death of Sokrates in 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
        and visited several foreign countries during the years
        immediately following; but he may have been at Athens in 394 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and may have served in the Athenian
        force at Corinth. See Mr. Clinton, Fast. Hell. ad ann. 395 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> I do not see how Plato could have
        been engaged in any battle of Delium <i>after</i> the battle of
        Corinth, for Athens was not then at war with the B&#339;otians. </p>
      <p>At the same time I confess that the account given by or
        ascribed to Aristoxenus appears to me to have been founded on
        little positive information, when we compare it with the
        military duty which Plato must have done between 410-405 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> </p>
      <p>It is curious that Antisthenes also is mentioned as having
        distinguished himself at the battle of Tanagra (Diog. vi. 1).
        The same remarks are applicable to him as have just been made
        upon Plato.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_5_5"
          id="Sidenotev1_5_5"></a>Period of political ambition.</span></p>
    <p>From the dangers, fatigues, and sufferings of such an historical
      decad, no Athenian citizen could escape, whatever might be his
      feeling towards the existing democracy, or however averse he might
      be to public employment by natural temper. But Plato was not thus
      averse, during the earlier years of his adult life. We know, from
      his own letters, that he then felt strongly the impulse of
      political ambition usual with young Athenians of good family;<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_5_12" href="#Footnotev1_5_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
      though probably not with any such premature vehemence as his
      younger brother Glaukon, whose impatience Sokrates is reported to
      have so judiciously moderated.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_13"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> Whether
      Plato ever spoke with success in the public assembly, we do not
      know: he is said to have been shy by nature, and his voice was
      thin and feeble, ill adapted for the Pnyx.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_5_14" href="#Footnotev1_5_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
      However, when the oligarchy of Thirty was established, after the
      capture and subjugation of Athens, Plato was not only relieved
      from the necessity of addressing the assembled people, but also
      obtained additional facilities for rising into political
      influence, through Kritias (his near relative) and Charmides,
      leading men among the new oligarchy. Plato affirms that he had
      always disapproved the antecedent democracy, and that he entered
      on the new scheme of government with full hope of seeing justice
      and wisdom predominant. He was soon undeceived. The government of
      the Thirty proved a sanguinary and rapacious tyranny,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_5_15" href="#Footnotev1_5_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
      filling him with disappointment and disgust. <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page252" id="v1page252"></a>252</span>He



      was especially revolted by their treatment of Sokrates, whom they
      not only interdicted from continuing his habitual colloquy with
      young men,<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_16" href="#Footnotev1_5_16"><span
          class="sp">16</span></a> but even tried to implicate in
      nefarious murders, by ordering him along with others to arrest
      Leon the Salaminian, one of their intended victims: an order which
      Sokrates, at the peril of his life, disobeyed. </p>

    <p>Thus mortified and disappointed, Plato withdrew from public
      functions. What part he took in the struggle between the oligarchy
      and its democratical assailants under Thrasybulus, we are not
      informed. But when the democracy was re-established, his political
      ambition revived, and he again sought to acquire some active
      influence on public affairs. Now however the circumstances had
      become highly unfavourable to him. The name of his deceased
      relative Kritias was generally abhorred, and he had no powerful
      partisans among the popular leaders. With such disadvantages, with
      anti-democratical sentiments, and with a thin voice, we cannot
      wonder that Plato soon found public life repulsive;<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_5_17" href="#Footnotev1_5_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
      though he admits the remarkable moderation displayed by the
      restored Demos. His repugnance was aggravated to the highest pitch
      of grief and indignation by the trial and condemnation of Sokrates
      (399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), four years after the
      renewal of the democracy. At that moment doubtless the Sokratic
      men or companions were unpopular in a body. Plato, after having
      yielded his best sympathy and aid at the trial of Sokrates,
      retired along with several others of them to Megara. He made up
      his mind that for a man of his views and opinions, it was not only
      unprofitable, but also unsafe, to embark in active public life,
      either at Athens or in any other Grecian city. He resolved to
      devote himself to philosophical speculation, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page253" id="v1page253"></a>253</span>and



      to abstain from practical politics; unless fortune should present

        &AElig;lian (V. H. iii. 27) had read a story to the effect, that
        Plato, in consequence of poverty, was about to seek military
        service abroad, and was buying arms for the purpose, when he was
        induced to stay by the exhortation of Sokrates, who prevailed
        upon him to devote himself to philosophy at home. </p>
      <p>If there be any truth in this story, it must refer to some time
        in the interval between the restoration of the democracy (403 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>) and the death of Sokrates (399 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>). The military service of Plato,
        prior to the battle of &AElig;gospotami (405 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>), must have been obligatory, in
        defence of his country, not depending on his own free choice. It
        is possible also that Plato may have been for the time
        impoverished, like many other citizens, by the intestine
        troubles in Attica, and may have contemplated military service
        abroad, like Xenophon.</p>
      <p>But I am inclined to think that the story is unfounded, and
        that it arises from some confusion between Plato and Xenophon.</p>

        The above account of Plato&#8217;s proceedings, perfectly natural and
        interesting, but unfortunately brief, is to be found in his
        seventh Epistle, p. 325-326.</p>

        of Sokrates &#8212; his travels.</span></p>
    <p>At Megara Plato passed some time with the Megarian Eukleides, his
      fellow-disciple in the society of Sokrates, and the founder of
      what is termed the Megaric school of philosophers. He next visited
      Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc;, where he is said to have become acquainted
      with the geometrician Theod&ocirc;rus, and to have studied
      geometry under him. From Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc; he proceeded to Egypt,
      interesting himself much in the antiquities of the country as well
      as in the conversation of the priests. In or about 394 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> &#8212; if we may trust the statement of
      Aristoxenus about the military service of Plato at Corinth, he was
      again at Athens. He afterwards went to Italy and Sicily, seeking
      the society of the Pythagorean philosophers, Archytas, Echekrates,
      Tim&aelig;us, &amp;c., at Tarentum and Lokri, and visiting the
      volcanic manifestations of &AElig;tna. It appears that his first
      visit to Sicily was made when he was about forty years of age,
      which would be 387 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Here he made
      acquaintance with the youthful Dion, over whom he acquired great
      intellectual ascendancy. By Dion Plato was prevailed upon to visit
      the elder Dionysius at Syracuse:<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_19"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> but that
      despot, offended by the free spirit of his conversation and
      admonitions, dismissed him with displeasure, and even caused him
      to be sold into slavery at &AElig;gina in his voyage home. Though
      really sold, however, Plato was speedily ransomed by friends.
      After farther incurring some risk of his life as an Athenian
      citizen, in consequence of the hostile feelings of the
      &AElig;ginetans, he was conveyed away safely to Athens, about 386

      <p>Cicero (De Fin. v. 29; Tusc. Disp. i. 17), and others, had

        reality seems to warrant. Val. Max. viii. 7, 3; Plin. Hist. Nat.

      <p>The Sophist Himerius repeats the same general statements about
        Plato&#8217;s early education, and extensive subsequent travels, but
        without adding any new particulars (Orat. xiv. 21-25).</p>
      <p>If we can trust a passage of Tzetzes, cited by Mr. Clinton (F.
        H. ad <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 366) and by Welcker
        (Trag. Gr. p. 1236), Dionysius the elder of Syracuse had

        against Plato.</p>

        &#8212; 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></span></p>
    <p>It was at this period, about 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
      that the continuous and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page254"
          id="v1page254"></a>254</span>formal public teaching of Plato,
      constituting as it does so great an epoch in philosophy,
      commenced. But I see no ground for believing, as many authors
      assume, that he was absent from Athens during the entire interval
      between 399-386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> I regard such
      long-continued absence as extremely improbable. Plato had not been
      sentenced to banishment, nor was he under any compulsion to stay
      away from his native city. He was not born &#8220;of an oak-tree or a
      rock&#8221; (to use an Homeric phrase, strikingly applied by Sokrates in
      his Apology to the Dikasts<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_21"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>), but of
      a noble family at Athens, where he had brothers and other
      connections. A temporary retirement, immediately after the death
      of Sokrates, might be congenial to his feelings and interesting in
      many ways; but an absence of moderate length would suffice for
      such exigencies, and there were surely reasonable motives to
      induce him to revisit his friends at home. I conceive Plato as
      having visited Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc;, Egypt, and Italy during these
      thirteen years, yet as having also spent part of this long time at
      Athens. Had he been continuously absent from that city he would
      have been almost forgotten, and would scarcely have acquired
      reputation enough to set up with success as a teacher.<a

        Stallbaum insists upon it as &#8220;certum et indubium&#8221; that Plato was
        absent from Athens continuously, without ever returning to it,
        for the thirteen years immediately succeeding the death of
        Sokrates. But I see no good evidence of this, and I think it
        highly improbable. See Stallbaum, Prolegg. ad Platon. Politicum,
        p. 38, 39. The statement of Strabo (xvii. 806), that Plato and
        Eudoxus passed thirteen years in Egypt, is not admissible. </p>
      <p>Ueberweg examines and criticises the statements about Plato&#8217;s
        travels. He considers it probable that Plato passed some part of
        these thirteen years at Athens (Ueber die Aechtheit und
        Zeitfolge der Platon. Schrift. p. 126, 127). Mr Fynes Clinton
        thinks the same. F. H. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 394;

    <p>The spot selected by Plato for his lectures or teaching was a
      garden adjoining the precinct sacred to the Hero Hekad&ecirc;mus
      or Akad&ecirc;mus, distant from the gate of Athens called Dipylon
      somewhat less than a mile, on the road to Eleusis, towards the
      north. In this precinct there were both walks, shaded by trees,
      and a gymnasium for bodily exercise; close adjoining, Plato either
      inherited or acquired a small dwelling-house and garden, his own
      private property.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_23" href="#Footnotev1_5_23"><span

        den Bestand der philosophischen Schulen in Athen, p. 8 (Berlin,
        1843). The Academy was consecrated to Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;; there
        was, however, a statue of Eros there, to whom sacrifice was
        offered, in conjunction with Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;. Athen&aelig;us,
        xiii. 561. </p>
      <p>At the time when Aristophanes assailed Sokrates in the comedy
        of the Nubes (423 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), the Academy
        was known and familiar as a place for gymnastic exercise; and
        Aristophanes (Nub. 995) singles it out as the proper scene of
        action for the honest and muscular youth, who despises rhetoric
        and philosophy. Aristophanes did not anticipate that within a
        short time after the representation of his last comedy, the most
        illustrious disciple of Sokrates would select the Academy as the
        spot for his residence and philosophical lectures, and would
        confer upon the name a permanent intellectual meaning, as
        designating the earliest and most memorable of the Hellenic
        schools. </p>
      <p>In 369 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when the school of
        Plato was in existence, the Athenian hoplites, marching to aid
        the Laced&aelig;monians in Peloponnesus, were ordered by
        Iphikrates to make their evening meal in the Academy (Xen. Hell.
        vi. 5, 49). </p>
      <p>The garden, afterwards established by Epikurus, was situated
        between the gate of Athens and the Academy: so that a person
        passed by it, when he walked forth from Athens to the Academy
        (Cic. De Fin. i. 1).</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_5_10"></a>Plato as a teacher &#8212; pupils numerous
        and wealthy, from different cities.</span></p>
    <p>We have scarce any particulars respecting the growth of the
      Academy from this time to the death of Plato, in 347 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> We only know generally that his fame
      as a lecturer became eminent and widely diffused: that among his
      numerous pupils were included Speusippus, Xenokrates, Aristotle,
      Demosthenes, Hyperides, Lykurgus, &amp;c.: that he was admired and
      consulted by Perdikkas in Macedonia and Dionysius at Syracuse:
      that he was also visited by listeners and pupils from all parts of
      Greece. Among them was Eudoxus of Knidus, who afterwards became
      illustrious both in geometry and astronomy. At the age of
      twenty-three, and in poor circumstances, Eudoxus was tempted by
      the reputation of the Sokratic men, and enabled by the aid of
      friends, to visit Athens: where, however, he was coldly received
      by Plato. Besides preparing an octennial period or
      octaet&ecirc;ris, and a descriptive map of the Heavens, Eudoxus
      also devised the astronomical hypothesis of Concentric Spheres &#8212;
      the earliest theory proposed to show that the apparent
      irregularity in the motion of the Sun and the Planets might be
      explained, and proved to result from a multiplicity of
      co-operating spheres or agencies, each in itself regular.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_5_24" href="#Footnotev1_5_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
      This theory of Eudoxus is said <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page256" id="v1page256"></a>256</span>to have
      originated in a challenge of Plato, who propounded to astronomers,
      in his oral discourse, the problem which they ought to try to
      solve.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_25" href="#Footnotev1_5_25"><span

        For an account of Eudoxus himself, of his theory of concentric
        spheres, and the subsequent extensions of it, see the
        instructive volume of the late lamented Sir George Cornewall
        Lewis, &#8212; Historical Survey of the Ancient Astronomy, ch. iii.
        sect. 3, p. 146 seq.</p>
      <p>M. Boeckh also (in his recent publication, Ueber die
        vierj&auml;hrigen Sonnenkreise der Alten, vorz&uuml;glich den
        Eudoxischen, Berlin, 1863) has given an account of the life and
        career of Eudoxus, not with reference to his theory of
        concentric spheres, but to his Calendar and Lunisolar Cycles or
        Periods, quadrennial and octennial. I think Boeckh is right in
        placing the voyage of Eudoxus to Egypt at an <i>earlier</i>
        period of the life of Eudoxus; that is, about 378 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>; and not in 362 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
        where it is placed by Letronne and others. Boeckh shows that the
        letters of recommendation from Agesilaus to Nektanebos, which
        Eudoxus took with him, do not necessarily coincide in time with
        the military expedition of Agesilaus to Egypt, but were more
        probably of earlier date. (Boeckh, p. 140-148.) </p>
      <p>Eudoxus lived 53 years (406-353 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
        about); being born when Plato was 21, and dying when Plato was
        75. He was one of the most illustrious men of the age. He was
        born in poor circumstances; but so marked was his early promise,
        that some of the medical school at Knidus assisted him to
        prosecute his studies &#8212; to visit Athens and hear the Sophists,
        Plato among them &#8212; to visit Egypt, Tarentum (where he studied
        geometry with Archytas), and Sicily (where he studied &#964;&#8048; &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8048;
        with Philistion). These facts depend upon the &#928;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962; of
        Kallimachus, which are good authority. (Diog. L. viii. 86.) </p>
      <p>After thus preparing himself by travelling and varied study,
        Eudoxus took up the profession of a Sophist, at Kyzikus and the
        neighbouring cities in the Propontis. He obtained great
        celebrity, and a large number of pupils. M. Boeckh says, &#8220;Dort
        lebte er als Sophist, sagt Sotion: das heisst, er lehrte, und
        hielt Vortrage. Dasselbe bezeugt Philostratos.&#8221; </p>
      <p>I wish to call particular attention to the way in which M.
        Boeckh here <span class="correction" title="amended from
          'de-describes'">describes</span> a Sophist of the fourth
        century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Nothing can be more
        correct. Every man who taught and gave lectures to audiences
        more or less numerous, was so called. The Platonic critics
        altogether darken the history of philosophy, by using the word <i>Sophist</i>
        with its modern associations (and the unmeaning abstract <i>Sophistic</i>
        which they derive from it), to represent a supposed school of
        speculative and deceptive corruptors. </p>
      <p>Eudoxus, having been coldly received when young and poor by
        Plato, had satisfaction in revisiting Athens at the height of
        his reputation, accompanied by numerous pupils &#8212; and in showing
        himself again to Plato. The two then became friends.
        Men&aelig;chmus and Helikon, geometrical pupils of Eudoxus,
        received instruction from Plato also; and Helikon accompanied
        Plato on his third voyage to Sicily (Plato, Epist. xiii. p. 360
        D; Plut. Dion, c. 19). Whether Eudoxus accompanied him there
        also, as Boeckh supposes, is doubtful: I think it improbable. </p>
      <p>Eudoxus ultimately returned to his native city of Knidus, where
        he was received with every demonstration of honour: a public
        vote of esteem and recognition being passed to welcome him. He
        is said to have been solicited to give laws to the city, and to
        have actually done so: how far this may be true, we cannot say.
        He also visited the neighbouring prince Maus&ocirc;lus of Karia,
        by whom he was much honoured. </p>
      <p>We know from Aristotle, that Eudoxus was not only illustrious
        as an astronomer and geometer, but that he also proposed a
        theory of Ethics, similar in its general formula to that which
        was afterwards laid down by Epikurus. Aristotle dissents from
        the theory, but he bears express testimony, in a manner very
        unusual with him, to the distinguished personal merit and virtue
        of Eudoxus (Ethic. Nikom. x. 3, p. 1172, b. 16).</p>

        Respecting Eudoxus, see Diog. L. viii. 86-91. As the life of
        Eudoxus probably extended from about 406-353 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>, his first visit to Athens would be
        about 383 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, some three years
        after Plato commenced his school. Strabo (xvii. 806), when he
        visited Heliopolis in Egypt, was shown by the guides certain
        cells or chambers which were said to have been occupied by Plato
        and Eudoxus, and was assured that the two had passed thirteen
        years together in Egypt. This account deserves no credit. Plato
        and Eudoxus visited Egypt, but not together, and neither of them
        for so long as thirteen years. Eudoxus stayed there sixteen
        months (Diog. L. viii. 87). Simplikius, Schol. ad Aristot. De

The
        Scholion of Simplikius, which follows at great length, is
        exceedingly interesting and valuable, in regard to the
        astronomical theory of Eudoxus, with the modifications
        introduced into it by Kallippus, Aristotle, and others. All the
        share in it which is claimed for Plato, is, that he described in
        clear language the problem to be solved: and even <i>that</i>
        share depends simply upon the statement of the Alexandrine
        Sosigenes (contemporary of Julius C&aelig;sar), not upon the
        statement of Eudemus. At least the language of Simplikius
        affirms, that Sosigenes copied from Eudemus the fact, that
        Eudoxus was the first Greek who proposed a systematic
        astronomical hypothesis to explain the motions of the planets &#8212;
        (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8217; &#917;&#8016;&#948;&#942;&#956;&#959;&#965; <span class="gesp">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> &#955;&#945;&#946;&#974;&#957;) not the
        circumstance, that Plato propounded the problem afterwards
        mentioned. From whom Sosigenes derived this last information, is
        not indicated. About his time, various fictions had gained
        credit in Egypt respecting the connection of Plato with Eudoxus,
        as we may see by the story of Strabo above cited. If Plato
        impressed upon others that which is here ascribed to him, he
        must have done so in <i>conversation or oral discourse</i> &#8212;
        for there is nothing in his written dialogues to that effect.
        Moreover, there is nothing in the dialogues to make us suppose
        that Plato adopted or approved the theory of Eudoxus. When Plato
        speaks of astronomy, either in the Republic, or in Leges, or in
        Epinomis, it is in a totally different spirit &#8212; not manifesting
        any care to save the astronomical phenomena. Both Aristotle
        himself (Metaphys. A. p. 1073 b.) and Simplikius, make it clear
        that Aristotle warmly espoused and enlarged the theory of
        Eudoxus. Theophrastus, successor of Aristotle, did the same. But
        we do not hear that either Speusippus or Xenokrates (successor
        of Plato) took any interest in the theory. This is one
        remarkable point of divergence between Plato and the Platonists
        on one side &#8212; Aristotle and the Aristotelians on the other &#8212; and
        much to the honour of the latter: for the theory of Eudoxus,
        though erroneous, was a great step towards improved scientific
        conceptions on astronomy, and a great provocative to farther
        observation of astronomical facts.</p>

    <p>Though Plato demanded no money as a fee for admission of pupils,
      yet neither did he scruple to receive presents from rich men such
      as Dionysius, Dion, and others.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_26"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> In the
      jests of Ephippus, Antiphanes, and other poets of the middle
      comedy, the pupils of Plato in the Academy are described as finely
      and delicately clad, nice in their persons even to affectation,
      with elegant caps and canes; which is the more to be noticed
      because the preceding comic poets derided Sokrates and his
      companions for qualities the very opposite &#8212; as prosing beggars,
      in mean attire and dirt.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_27"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> Such
      students must have belonged to opulent <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page258" id="v1page258"></a>258</span>families; and we
      may be sure that they requited their master by some valuable
      present, though no fee may have been formally demanded from them.
      Some conditions (though we do not know what) were doubtless
      required for admission. Moreover the example of Eudoxus shows that
      in some cases even ardent and promising pupils were practically
      repelled. At any rate, the teaching of Plato formed a marked
      contrast with that extreme and indiscriminate publicity which
      characterised the conversation of Sokrates, who passed his days in
      the market-place or in the public porticoes or
      pal&aelig;str&aelig;; while Plato both dwelt and discoursed in a
      quiet residence and garden a little way out of Athens. The title
      of Athens to be considered the training-city of Hellas (as
      Perikles had called her fifty years before), was fully sustained
      by the Athenian writers and teachers between 390-347; especially
      by Plato and Isokrates, the most celebrated and largely
      frequented. So many foreign pupils came to Isokrates that he
      affirms most of his pecuniary gains to have been derived from
      non-Athenians. Several of his pupils stayed with him three or four
      years. The like is doubtless true about the pupils of Plato.<a

        Tiro (Cic. Epist. Fam. xvi. 23), describes in animated terms
        both his admiration for the person and abilities, and his
        delight in the private society, of Kratippus. Several of Plato&#8217;s

        Second visit to the same &#8212; mortifying failure.</span></p>
    <p>It was in the year 367-366 that Plato was induced, by the earnest
      entreaties of Dion, to go from Athens to Syracuse, on a visit to
      the younger Dionysius, who had just become despot, succeeding to
      his father of the same name. Dionysius II., then very young, had
      manifested some dispositions towards philosophy, and prodigious
      admiration for Plato: who was encouraged by Dion to hope that he
      would have influence enough to bring about an amendment or <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page259" id="v1page259"></a>259</span>thorough



      reform of the government at Syracuse. This ill-starred visit, with
      its momentous sequel, has been described in my &#8216;History of
      Greece&#8217;. It not only failed completely, but made matters worse
      rather than better: Dionysius became violently alienated from
      Dion, and sent him into exile. Though turning a deaf ear to
      Plato&#8217;s recommendations, he nevertheless liked his conversation,
      treated him with great respect, detained him for some time at
      Syracuse, and was prevailed upon, only by the philosopher&#8217;s
      earnest entreaties, to send him home. Yet in spite of such
      uncomfortable experience Plato was induced, after a certain
      interval, again to leave Athens and pay a second visit to
      Dionysius, mainly in hopes of procuring the restoration of Dion.
      In this hope too he was disappointed, and was glad to return,
      after a longer stay than he wished, to Athens. </p>

      equipped an armament against Dionysius. Notwithstanding the
      inadequacy of his force he had the good fortune to make himself
      master of Syracuse, being greatly favoured by the popular
      discontent of Syracusans against the reigning despot: but he did
      not know how to deal with the people, nor did he either satisfy
      their aspirations towards liberty, or realise his own engagements.
      Retaining in his hands a despotic power, similar in the main to
      that of Dionysius, he speedily became odious, and was assassinated
      by the treachery of Kallippus, his companion in arms as well as
      fellow-pupil of the Platonic Academy. The state of Syracuse, torn
      by the joint evils of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page260"

      and these reproaches were still further embittered by the entire

      saddened by the disastrous turn of events at Syracuse, aggravated
      by the discreditable abuse of power and violent death of his
      intimate friend Dion, which brought dishonour both upon himself
      and upon the Academy. Nevertheless he lived to the age of eighty,
      and died in 348-347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, leaving a

      But his foundation, the Academy, did not die with him. It passed
      to his nephew Speusippus, who succeeded him as teacher, conductor
      of the school, or Scholarch: and was himself succeeded after eight
      years by Xenokrates of Chalk&ecirc;don: while another pupil of the
      Academy, Aristotle, after an absence of some years from Athens,
      returned thither and established a school of his own at the

    <p>The latter half of Plato&#8217;s life in his native city must have been
      one of dignity and consideration, though not of any of political
      activity. He is said to have addressed the Dikastery as an
      advocate for the accused general Chabrias: and we are told that he
      discharged the expensive and showy functions of Chor&ecirc;gus,
      with funds supplied by Dion.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_32"

      of Athens also his reputation was very great. When he went to the
      Olympic festival of <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 360, he was
      an object of conspicuous attention and respect: he was visited by
      hearers, young men of rank and ambition, from the most distant
      Hellenic cities; and his advice was respectfully invoked both by
      Perdikkas in Macedonia and by Dionysius II. at Syracuse. During
      his last visit to Syracuse, it is said that some of the students
      in the Academy, among whom Aristotle is mentioned, became
      dissatisfied with his absence, and tried to set up a new school;
      but were prevented by Iphikrates and Chabrias, the powerful
      friends of Plato at Athens. This story is connected with alleged
      ingratitude on the part of Aristotle towards Plato, and with
      alleged repugnance on the part of Plato towards Aristotle.<a

      The fact itself &#8212; that during Plato&#8217;s absence in Sicily his
      students sought to provide for themselves instruction and
      discussion elsewhere &#8212; is neither surprising nor blameable. And as
      to Aristotle, there is ground for believing that he passed for an
      intimate friend and disciple of Plato, even during the last ten
      years of Plato&#8217;s life. For we read that Aristotle, following <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page262" id="v1page262"></a>262</span>
      speculations and principles of teaching of his own, on the subject
      of rhetoric, found himself at variance with Isokrates and the
      Isokratean school. Aristotle attacked Isokrates and his mode of
      dealing with the subject: upon which Kephisod&ocirc;rus (one of the
      disciples of Isokrates) retaliated by attacking Plato and the
      Platonic Ideas, considering Aristotle as one of Plato&#8217;s scholars
      and adherents.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_34" href="#Footnotev1_5_34"><span

        Plut. Aristeides, c. 1; Diog. Laert. iii. 23-24. Diogenes says
        that no other Athenian except Plato dared to speak publicly in
        defence of Chabrias; but this can hardly be correct, since
        Aristotle mentions another &#963;&#965;&#957;&#942;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#959;&#962; named Lykoleon (Rhet. iii.

        Chabrias alluded to by Aristotle is the same as that alluded to
        by Diogenes, that which arose out of the wrongful occupation of
        Or&ocirc;pus by the Thebans. If Plato appeared at the trial, I
        doubt whether it could have occurred in 366 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
        as Clinton supposes; Plato must have been absent during that
        year in Sicily.</p>
      <p>The anecdote given by Diogenes, in relation to Plato&#8217;s
        appearance at this trial, deserves notice. Krobylus, one of the
        accusers, said to him, &#8220;Are <i>you</i> come to plead on behalf
        of another? Are not you aware that the hemlock of Sokrates is in
        store for <i>you</i> also?&#8221; Plato replied: &#8220;I affronted dangers
        formerly, when I went on military expedition, for my country,
        and I am prepared to affront them now in discharge of my duty to
        a friend&#8221; (iii. 24).</p>
      <p>This anecdote is instructive, as it exhibits the continuance of
        the anti-philosophical antipathies at Athens among a
        considerable portion of the citizens, and as it goes to attest
        the military service rendered personally by Plato.</p>
      <p>Diogenes (iii. 46) gives a long list of hearers; and
        Athen&aelig;us (xi. 506-509) enumerates several from different
        cities in Greece: Euphr&aelig;us of Oreus (in Eub&#339;a), who
        acquired through Plato&#8217;s recommendation great influence with
        Perdikkas, king of Macedonia, and who is said to have excluded
        from the society of that king every one ignorant of philosophy
        and geometry; Euagon of Lampsakus, Tim&aelig;us of Kyzikus,
        Ch&aelig;ron of Pell&ecirc;n&ecirc;, all of whom tried, and the
        last with success, to usurp the sceptre in their respective
        cities; Eud&ecirc;mus of Cyprus; Kallippus the Athenian,
        fellow-learner with Dion in the Academy, afterwards his
        companion in his expedition to Sicily, ultimately his murderer;
        Herakleides and Python from &AElig;nus in Thrace, Chion and
        Leonides, also Klearchus the despot from the Pontic Herakleia
        (Justin, xvi. 5).</p>
      <p>Several of these examples seem to have been cited by the orator
        Demochar&ecirc;s (nephew of Demosthenes) in his speech at Athens
        vindicating the law proposed by Sophokles for the expulsion of
        the philosophers from Athens (Athen&aelig;. xi. 508 F), a speech
        delivered about 306 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Plutarch
        compliments Plato for the active political liberators and
        tyrannicides who came forth from the Academy: he considers Plato
        as the real author and planner of the expedition of Dion against
        Dionysius, and expatiates on the delight which Plato must have
        derived from it &#8212; a supposition very incorrect (Plutarch, Non
        Posse Suav. p. 1097 B; adv. Kol&ocirc;ten, p. 1126 B-C).</p>

      <p>The friendship and reciprocity of service between Plato and

      <p>Cicero affirms, on the authority of the Epistles of

        hearer as well as reader of Plato (Cic. Brut. 31, 121; Orat. 4,
        15). I think this fact highly probable, but the epistles which
        Cicero read no longer exist. Among the five Epistles remaining,
        Plato is once mentioned with respect in the fifth (p. 1490), but
        this epistle is considered by most critics spurious.</p>

        have happened in the latter years of Plato&#8217;s life, for Aristotle
        must have been at least twenty-five or twenty-six years of age
        when he engaged in such polemics. He was born in 384 <span

          id="Sidenotev1_5_16"></a>Little known about Plato&#8217;s personal
        history.</span></p>
    <p>Such is the sum of our information respecting Plato. Scanty as it
      is, we have not even the advantage of contemporary authority for
      any portion of it. We have no description of Plato from any
      contemporary author, friendly or adverse. It will be seen that
      after the death of Sokrates we know nothing about Plato as a man
      and a citizen, except the little which can be learnt from his few
      Epistles, all written when he was very old, and relating almost
      entirely to his peculiar relations with Dion and Dionysius. His
      dialogues, when we try to interpret them collectively, and gather
      from them general results as to the character and purposes of the
      author, suggest valuable arguments and perplexing doubts, but
      yield few solutions. In no one of the dialogues does Plato address
      us in his own person. In the Apology alone (which is not a
      dialogue) is he alluded to even as present: in the Ph&aelig;don he
      is mentioned as absent from illness. Each of the dialogues, direct
      or indirect, is conducted from beginning to end by the persons
      whom he introduces.<a name="FnAnchorv1_5_35"
        href="#Footnotev1_5_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> Not one
      of the dialogues affords any positive internal evidence showing
      the date of its composition. In a few there are allusions to prove
      that they must have been composed at a period later than others,
      or later than some given event of known date; but nothing more can
      be positively established. Nor is there any good extraneous
      testimony to determine the date of any one among them. For the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page263" id="v1page263"></a>263</span>remark



      ascribed to Sokrates about the dialogue called Lysis (which
      remark, if authentic, would prove the dialogue to have been
      composed during the life-time of Sokrates) appears altogether
      untrustworthy. And the statement of some critics, that the
      Ph&aelig;drus was Plato&#8217;s earliest composition, is clearly nothing
      more than an inference (doubtful at best, and, in my judgment,
      erroneous) from its dithyrambic style and erotic subject.<a

        On this point Aristotle, in the dialogues which he composed, did
        not follow Plato&#8217;s example. Aristotle introduced two or more
        persons debating a question, but he appeared in his own person
        to give the solution, or at least to wind up the debate. He
        sometimes also opened the debate by a pro&#339;m or prefatory address
        in his own person (Cic. ad Attic. iv. 16, 2, xiii. 19, 4).
        Cicero followed the manner of Aristotle, not that of Plato. His
        dialogues are rhetorical rather than dramatic.</p>

    <h2>PLATONIC CANON, AS RECOGNISED BY THRASYLLUS.</h2>
    <p>As we know little about Plato except from his works, the first
      question to be decided is, Which <i>are</i> his real works? Where
      are we to find a trustworthy Platonic Canon? </p>

        discussions.</span></p>
    <p>Down to the close of the last century this question was not much
      raised or discussed. The catalogue recognised by the rhetor
      Thrasyllus (contemporary with the Emperor Tiberius) was generally
      accepted as including none but genuine works of Plato; and was
      followed as such by editors and critics, who were indeed not very
      numerous.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_1" href="#Footnotev1_6_1"><span
          class="sp">1</span></a> But the discussions carried on during
      the present century have taken a different turn. While editors,
      critics, and translators have been greatly multiplied, some of the
      most distinguished among them, Schleiermacher at the head, have
      either professedly set aside, or in practice disregarded, the
      Thrasyllean catalogue, as if it carried no authority and very
      faint presumption. They have reasoned upon each dialogue as if its
      title to be considered genuine were now to be proved for the first
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page265" id="v1page265"></a>265</span>time;



      either by external testimony (mentioned in Aristotle or others),
      or by internal evidences of style, handling, and thoughts:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_2" href="#Footnotev1_6_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
      as if, in other words, the <i>onus probandi</i> lay upon any one
      who believed the printed works of Plato to be genuine &#8212; not upon
      an opponent who disputes the authenticity of any one or more among
      them, and rejects it as spurious. Before I proceed to examine the
      conclusions, alike numerous and discordant, which these critics
      have proclaimed, I shall enquire how far the method which they
      have pursued is warrantable. Is there any presumption at all &#8212; and
      if so, what amount of presumption &#8212; in favour of the catalogue
      transmitted from antiquity by Thrasyllus, as a canon containing
      genuine works of Plato and no others?</p>

        The following passage from Wyttenbach, written in 1776, will
        give an idea of the state of Platonic criticism down to the last

        seems not to have entered his thoughts.</p>

        To see that this is the general method of proceeding, we have
        only to look at the work of Ueberweg, one of the most recent and
        certainly one of the ablest among the Platonic critics.

    <p>Upon this question I hold an opinion opposite to that of the

    <p>We have seen that Plato passed the last thirty-eight years of his
      life (except his two short visits to Syracuse) as a writer and
      lecturer at Athens; that he purchased and inhabited a fixed
      residence at the Academy, near the city. We know, moreover, that
      his principal pupils, especially (his nephew) Speusippus and
      Xenokrates, were constantly with him in this residence during his
      life; that after his death the residence became permanently
      appropriated as a philosophical school for lectures, study,
      conversation, and friendly meetings of studious men, in which
      capacity it served for more than two centuries;<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_3" href="#Footnotev1_6_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
      that his nephew Speusippus succeeded him there as teacher, and
      taught there for <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page266"
          id="v1page266"></a>266</span>eight years, being succeeded
      after his death first by Xenokrates (for twenty-five years),
      afterwards by Polemon, Krantor, Krates, Arkesilaus, and others in
      uninterrupted series; that the school always continued to be
      frequented, though enjoying greater or less celebrity according to
      the reputation of the Scholarch. </p>

        The teaching and conversation of the Platonic School continued
        fixed in the spot known as the Academy until the siege of Athens
        by Sylla in 87 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The teacher was
        then forced to confine himself to the interior of the city,
        where he gave lectures in the gymnasium called Ptolem&aelig;um.
        In that gymnasium Cicero heard the lectures of the Scholarch
        Antiochus, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 79; walking out
        afterwards to visit the deserted but memorable site of the
        Academy (Cic. De Fin. v. 1; C. G. Zumpt, Ueber den Bestand der
        Philosophischen Schulen in Athen, p. 14, Berlin, 1843). The
        ground of the Academy, when once deserted, speedily became
        unhealthy, and continues to be so now, as Zumpt mentions that he
        himself experienced in 1835.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_6_4"
          id="Sidenotev1_6_4"></a>Importance of this foundation.
        Preservation of Plato&#8217;s manuscripts. School library.</span></p>
    <p>By thus perpetuating the school which his own genius had
      originated, and by providing for it permanent support with a fixed
      domicile, Plato inaugurated a new epoch in the history of
      philosophy: this example was followed a few years afterwards by
      Aristotle, Zeno, and Epikurus. Moreover the proceeding was
      important in another way also, as it affected the preservation and
      authentication of his own manuscripts and compositions. It
      provided not only safe and lasting custody, such as no writer had
      ever enjoyed before, for Plato&#8217;s original manuscripts, but also a
      guarantee of some efficacy against any fraud or error which might
      seek to introduce other compositions into the list. That Plato
      himself was not indifferent on this head we may fairly believe,
      since we learn from Dionysius of Halikarnassus, that he was
      indefatigable in the work of correction: and his disciples, who
      took the great trouble of noting down themselves what he spoke in
      his lectures, would not be neglectful as to the simpler duty of
      preserving his manuscripts.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_4"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Now
      Speusippus and Xenokrates (also Aristotle, Hesti&aelig;us, the
      Opuntian Philippus, and the other Platonic pupils) must have had
      personal knowledge of all that Plato had written, whether finished
      dialogues, unfinished fragments, or preparatory sketches. They had
      perfect means of distinguishing his real compositions from
      forgeries passed off in his name: and they had every motive to
      expose such forgeries (if any were attempted) wherever they <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page267" id="v1page267"></a>267</span>could,



      in order to uphold the reputation of their master. If any one
      composed a dialogue and circulated it under the name of Plato, the
      school was a known place, and its occupants were at hand to give
      information to all who enquired about the authenticity of the
      composition. The original MSS. of Plato (either in his own
      handwriting or in that of his secretary, if he employed one<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_5" href="#Footnotev1_6_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>)
      were doubtless treasured up in the school as sacred memorials of
      the great founder, and served as originals from which copies of
      unquestionable fidelity might be made, whenever the Scholarch
      granted permission. How long they continued to be so preserved we
      cannot say: nor do we know what was the condition of the MSS., or
      how long they were calculated to last. But probably many of the
      students frequenting the school would come for the express purpose
      of reading various works of Plato (either in the original MSS., or
      in faithful copies taken from them) with the exposition of the
      Scholarch; just as we know that the Roman M. Crassus (mentioned by
      Cicero), during his residence at Athens, studied the Platonic
      Gorgias with the aid of the Scholarch Charmadas.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_6" href="#Footnotev1_6_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
      The presidency of Speusippus and Xenokrates (taken jointly) lasted
      for thirty-three years; and even when they were replaced by
      successors who had enjoyed no personal intimacy with Plato, the
      motive to preserve the Platonic MSS. would still be operative, and
      the means of verifying what was really Platonic would still be
      possessed in the school. The original MSS. would be preserved,
      along with the treatises or dialogues which each successive
      Scholarch himself composed; thus forming a permanent and
      increasing school-library, probably enriched more or less by works
      acquired or purchased from others. </p>

        a. 12) Simplikius mentions Herakleides (of Pontus),
        Hesti&aelig;us, and even Aristotle himself, as having taken
        notes of the same lectures. </p>
      <p>Hermod&ocirc;rus appears to have carried some of Plato&#8217;s
        dialogues to Sicily, and to have made money by selling them. See
        Cicero ad Atticum, xiii. 21: Suidas et Zenobius &#8212; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#957;

        In the above-mentioned epistle Cicero compares his own relations
        with Atticus, to those of Plato with Hermod&ocirc;rus.
        Hermod&ocirc;rus had composed a treatise respecting Plato, from
        which some extracts were given by Derkyllides (the contemporary
        of Thrasyllus) as well as by Simplikius (Zeller, De Hermod. p.
        20-21).</p>

      of their MSS.? Where was any certain permanent custody provided
      for them? Isokrates had many pupils during his life, but left no
      school or &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; after his death. If any one composed a

    <p>Again, the existence of this school-library explains more easily
      how it is that unfinished, inferior, and fragmentary Platonic
      compositions have been preserved. That there must have existed
      such compositions I hold to be certain. How is it supposable that
      any author, even Plato could have brought to completion such
      masterpieces as Republic, Gorgias, Protagoras, Symposion, &amp;c.,
      without tentative and preparatory sketches, each of course in
      itself narrow, defective, perhaps of little value, but serving as
      material to be worked up or worked in? Most of these would be
      destroyed, but probably not all. If (as I believe) it be the fact,
      that all the Platonic MSS. were preserved as their author left
      them, some would probably be published (and some indeed are said
      to have been published) after his death; and among them would be
      included more or fewer of these unfinished performances, and
      sketches projected but abandoned. We can hardly suppose that Plato
      himself would have published fragments never finished, such as
      Kleitophon and Kritias<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_8"

        Straton, the Peripatetic Scholarch who succeeded Theophrastus, <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> 287, bequeathed to Lykon by his will
        both the succession to his school (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#8052;&#957;) and all his books,
        except what he had written himself (&#960;&#955;&#8052;&#957; &#8039;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054; &#947;&#949;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;).
        What is to be done with these latter he does not say. Lykon, in
        his last will, says:&#8212;&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#973;&#959; &#956;&#957;&#8118;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; (Chares, a manumitted

        73. Here Lykon directs expressly that Kallinus shall edit with
        care his (Lykon&#8217;s) unpublished works. Probably Straton may have
        given similar directions during his life, so that it was
        unnecessary to provide in the will. &#932;&#8048; &#7936;&#957;&#949;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945; is equivalent
        to &#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#954;&#948;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;. Publication was constituted by reading the
        MSS. aloud before a chosen audience of friends or critics; which
        readings often led to such remarks as induced the author to take
        his work back, and to correct it for a second recitation. See
        the curious sentence extracted from the letter of Theophrastus
        to Phanias (Diog. L. v. 37). Boeckh and other critics agree that
        both the Kleitophon and the Kritias were transmitted from
        antiquity in the fragmentary state in which we now read them:
        that they were compositions never completed. Boeckh affirms this
        with assurance respecting the Kleitophon, though he thinks that
        it is not a genuine work of Plato; on which last point I dissent
        from him. He thinks that the Kritias is a real work of Plato,
        though uncompleted (Boeckh in Platonis Minoem, p. 11).</p>
      <p>Compare the remarks of M. Littr&eacute; respecting the
        unfinished sketches, treatises, and notes not intended for
        publication, included in the Collectio Hippocratica (&#338;uvres d&#8217;

    <p>The second philosophical school, begun by Aristotle and

      at the Lykeum on the eastern side of Athens, was established on
      the model of that of Plato. That which formed the centre or
      consecrating point was a Museum or chapel of the Muses: with
      statues of those goddesses of place, and also a statue of the
      founder. Attached to this Museum were a portico, a hall with seats
      (one seat especially for the lecturing professor), a garden, and a
      walk, together with a residence, all permanently appropriated to
      the teacher and the process of instruction.<a

        Respecting the domicile of the Platonic School, and that of the
        Aristotelian or Peripatetic school which followed it, the
        particulars given by Diogenes are nearly coincident: we know
        more in detail about the Peripatetic, from what he cites out of
        the will of Theophrastus. See iv. 1-6-19, v. 51-63. </p>
      <p>The &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; at the Academy was established by Plato himself.
        Speusippus placed in it statues of the Charities or Graces.
        Theophrastus gives careful directions in his about repairing and
        putting in the best condition, the Peripatetic &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, with
        its altar, its statues of the Goddesses, and its statue of the
        founder Aristotle. The &#963;&#964;&#959;&#8048;, &#7952;&#958;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#945;, &#954;&#8134;&#960;&#959;&#962;, &#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, attached
        to both schools, are mentioned: the most zealous students
        provided for themselves lodgings close adjoining. Cicero, when
        he walked out from Athens to see the deserted Academy, was
        particularly affected by the sight of the <i>exedra</i>, in
        which Charmadas had lectured (De Fin. v. 2, 4).</p>
      <p>There were periodical meetings, convivial and conversational,
        among the members both of the Academic and Peripatetic schools;
        and &#958;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#953; by Xenokrates and Aristotle to regulate
        them (Athen&aelig;us, v. 184). </p>
      <p>Epikurus (in his interesting testament given by Diogen. Laert.
        x. 16-21) bequeaths to two Athenian citizens his garden and
        property, in trust for his principal disciple the
        Mitylen&aelig;an Hermarchus, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;, &#954;&#945;&#8054;

        given to Hermarchus: they would form the school-library.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the school-library at the Lykeum acquired large
      development and importance. It not only included all the MS.
      compositions, published or unpublished, of Aristotle and
      Theophrastus, each of them a voluminous writer &#8212; but also a
      numerous collection (numerous for that day) of other works
      besides; since both of them were opulent and fond of collecting
      books. The value of the school-library is shown by what happened
      after the decease of Theophrastus, when Straton succeeded him in
      the school (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 287). Theophrastus &#8212;
      thinking himself entitled to treat the library not as belonging to
      the school but as belonging to himself &#8212; bequeathed it at his
      death to Neleus, a favourite scholar, and a native of
      Sk&ecirc;psis (in the Troad), by whom it was carried away to Asia,
      and permanently separated from the Aristotelian school at Athens.
      The manuscripts composing it remained in the possession of Neleus
      and his heirs for more than a century and a half, long hidden in a
      damp cellar, neglected, and sustaining great damage &#8212; until about
      the year 100 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when they were
      purchased by a rich Athenian named Apellikon, and brought back to
      Athens. Sylla, after he had captured Athens (86 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>), took for himself the library of
      Apellikon, and transported it to Rome, where it became open to
      learned men (Tyrannion, Andronikus, and others), but under
      deplorable disadvantage &#8212; in consequence of the illegible state of
      the MSS. and the unskilful conjectures and restitutions which had
      been applied, in the new copies made since it passed into the
      hands of Apellikon.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_10"

        The will of Theophrastus, as given in Diogenes (v. 52), mentions
        the bequest of all his books to Neleus. But it is in Strabo that

      <p>The kings of Pergamus, a few years after the death of
        Theophrastus, acquired possession of the town and territory of
        Sk&ecirc;psis; so that the heirs of Neleus became numbered among
        their subjects. These kings (from about the year <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> 280 downwards) manifested great
        eagerness to collect a library at Pergamus, in competition with
        that of the Ptolemies at Alexandria. The heirs of Neleus were
        afraid that these kings would strip them of their Aristotelian
        MSS., either for nothing or for a small price. They therefore
        concealed the MSS. in a cellar, until they found an opportunity
        of selling them to a stranger out of the country. (Strabo, l.
        c.) </p>
      <p>This narrative of Strabo is one of the most interesting pieces
        of information remaining to us about literary antiquity. He had
        himself received instruction from Tyrannion (xii. 548): he had
        gone through a course of Aristotelian philosophy (xvi. 757), and
        he had good means of knowing the facts from the Aristotelian
        critics, including his master Tyrannion. Plutarch (Vit.
        Syll&aelig;, c. 26) and Athen&aelig;us (i. 3) allude to the same
        story. Athen&aelig;us says that Ptolemy Philadelphus purchased
        the MSS. from the heirs of Neleus, which cannot be correct. </p>
      <p>Some critics have understood the narrative of Strabo, as if he
        had meant to affirm, that the works of Aristotle had never got
        into circulation until the time of Apellikon. It is against this
        supposition that Stahr contends (very successfully) in his work
        &#8220;Aristotelia&#8221;. But Strabo does not affirm so much as this. He
        does not say anything to contradict the supposition that there
        were copies of various books of Aristotle in circulation, during
        the lives of Aristotle and Theophrastus.</p>

      of the Aristotelian library, from the Peripatetic school at Athens
      to the distant and obscure town of Sk&ecirc;psis, was the result
      of some jealousy on the part of Theophrastus; that he wished to
      secure to Neleus the honourable and lucrative post of becoming his
      successor in the school, and conceived that he was furthering that
      object by bequeathing the library to Neleus. If he entertained any
      such wish, it was disappointed. The succession devolved upon
      another pupil of the school, Straton of Lampsakus. But Straton and
      his successors were forced to get on as well as they could without
      their library. The Peripatetic school at Athens suffered severely
      by the loss. Its professors possessed only a few of the
      manuscripts of Aristotle, and those too the commonest and best
      known. If a student came with a view to read any of the other
      Aristotelian works (as Crassus went to read the Gorgias of Plato),
      the Scholarch was unable to assist him: as far as Aristotle was
      concerned, they could only expand and adorn, in the way of
      lecture, a few of his familiar doctrines.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_11"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> We hear
      that the character of the school was materially altered. Straton
      deserted the track of Aristotle, and threw himself into
      speculations of his own (seemingly able and ingenious), chiefly on
      physical topics.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_12" href="#Footnotev1_6_12"><span

    <p>This history of the Aristotelian library illustrates forcibly, by
      way of contrast, the importance to the Platonic school of having
      preserved its MSS. from the beginning, without any similar
      interruption. What Plato left in manuscript we may presume to have
      never been removed: those who came to study his works had the
      means of doing so: those who wanted to know whether any
      composition was written by him, what works he had written
      altogether, or what was the correct reading in a case of obscurity
      or dispute &#8212; had always the means of informing themselves. Whereas
      the Peripatetic Scholarch, after the death of Theophrastus, could
      give no similar information as to the works of Aristotle.<a

        An interesting citation by Simplikius (in his commentary on the
        Physica of Aristotle, fol. 216, a. 7, p. 404, b. 11, Schol.
        Brandis shows us that Theophrastus, while he was resident at
        Athens as Peripatetic Scholarch, had custody of the original
        MSS. of the works of Aristotle and that he was applied to by
        those who wished to procure correct copies. Eud&ecirc;mus (of
        Rhodes) having only a defective copy of the Physica, wrote to
        request that Theophrastus would cause to be written out a
        certain portion of the fifth book, and send it to him,

      Cicero, and Plutarch.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_15"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> His life
      was passed at Alexandria, and seems to have been comprised between
      260-184 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; as far as can be made
      out. During the latter portion of it he became chief librarian &#8212;
      an appointment <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page274"
          id="v1page274"></a>274</span>which he had earned by long
      previous studies in the place, as well as by attested experience
      in the work of criticism and arrangement. He began his studious
      career at Alexandria at an early age: and he received instruction,
      as a boy from Zenodotus, as a young man from Kallimachus &#8212; both of
      whom were, in succession, librarians of the Alexandrine library.<a

      We must observe that Diogenes does not expressly state the
      distribution of the Platonic works into trilogies to have been <i>first



        proposed</i> or originated by Aristophanes (as he states that
      the tetralogies were afterwards proposed by the rhetor Thrasyllus,
      of which presently): his language is rather more consistent with
      the supposition, that it was first proposed by some one earlier,
      and adopted or sanctioned by the eminent authority of
      Aristophanes. But at any rate, the distribution was proposed
      either by Aristophanes himself, or by some one before him and
      known to him. </p>

      <p>Aristophanes composed Argumenta to many of the Attic tragedies
        and comedies: he also arranged in a certain order the songs of
        Alk&aelig;us and the odes of Pindar. Boeckh (Pr&aelig;fat. ad
        Scholia Pindari, p. x. xi.) remarks upon the mistake made by
        Quintilian as well as by others, in supposing that Pindar
        arranged his own odes. Respecting the wide range of erudition
        embraced by Aristophanes, see F. A. Wolf, Prolegg. in Homer, pp.
        218-220, and Schneidewin, De Hypothes. Traged. Gr&aelig;c.

    <p>This fact is of material importance, because it enables us to

      the Alexandrine library, certainly during the lifetime of
      Aristophanes, and probably before it. It is there only that
      Aristophanes could have known them; his whole life having been
      passed in Alexandria. The first formal appointment of a librarian
      to the Alexandrine Museum was made by Ptolemy Philadelphus, at
      some time after the commencement of his reign in 285 <span

      <p>When Zenodotus was appointed, the library had already attained

        was then conspicuous and dignified. But Demetrius Phalereus, who
        preceded Zenodotus, began his operations when there was no
        library at all, and gradually accumulated the number of books
        which Zenodotus found. Heyne observes justly: &#8220;Primo loco

    <p>These tables of Kallimachus (of which one by itself, No. 2,
      reached to 120 books) must have been an encyclop&aelig;dia, far
      more comprehensive than any previously compiled, of Greek authors
      and literature. Such tables indeed could not have been compiled
      before the existence of the Alexandrine Museum. They described
      what Kallimachus had before him in that museum, as we may see by
      the general title &#924;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; prefixed: moreover we may be sure that
      nowhere else could he have had access to the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page276" id="v1page276"></a>276</span>multitude



      of books required. Lastly, the tables also show how large a
      compass the Alexandrine Museum and library had attained at the
      time when Kallimachus put together his compilation: that is,
      either in the reign of Ptolemy II. Philadelphia (285-247 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>), or in the earlier portion of the
      reign of Ptolemy III., called Euergetes (247-222 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>). Nevertheless, large as the library
      then was, it continued to increase. A few years afterwards,
      Aristophanes published a work commenting upon the tables of
      Kallimachus, with additions and enlargements: of which work the
      title alone remains.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_19"

        time of Kallimachus.</span></p>
    <p>Now, I have already observed, that the works of Plato were
      certainly in the Alexandrine library, at the time when
      Aristophanes either originated or sanctioned the distribution of
      them into Trilogies. Were they not also in the library at the time
      when Kallimachus compiled his tables? I cannot but conclude that
      they were in it at that time also. When we are informed that the
      catalogue of enumerated authors filled so many books, we may be
      sure that it must have descended, and we know in fact that it did
      descend, to names far less important and distinguished than that
      of Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_20" href="#Footnotev1_6_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a> The name of Plato himself can hardly
      have been omitted. Demokritus and his works, especially the
      peculiar and technical words (&#947;&#955;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953;) in them, received special
      attention from Kallimachus: which proves that the latter was not
      disposed to pass over the philosophers. But Demokritus, though an
      eminent philosopher, was decidedly less eminent than Plato:
      moreover he left behind him no permanent successors, school, or
      &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, at Athens, to preserve his MSS. or foster his celebrity.
      As the library was furnished at that time with a set of the works
      of Demokritus, so I infer that it could not have been without a
      set of the works of Plato. That Kallimachus was acquainted <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page277" id="v1page277"></a>277</span>with



      Plato&#8217;s writings (if indeed such a fact requires proof), we know,
      not only from his epigram upon the Ambrakiot Kleombrotus (whom he
      affirms to have killed himself after reading the Ph&aelig;don),
      but also from a curious intimation that he formally impugned
      Plato&#8217;s competence to judge or appreciate poets &#8212; alluding to the
      severe criticisms which we read in the Platonic Republic.<a

        Thus the Tables of Kallimachus included a writer named
        Lysimachus, a disciple of Theodorus or Theophrastus, and his
        writings (Athen&aelig;. vi. 252) &#8212; a rhetor and poet named
        Dionysius with the epithet of &#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#962; (Athen&aelig;. xv. 669)) &#8212;
        and even the treatises of several authors on cakes and cookery
        (Athen&aelig;. xiv. 643). The names of authors absolutely
        unknown to us were mentioned by him (Athen&aelig;. ii. 70).

      <p>Eratosthenes, successor of Kallimachus as librarian at
        Alexandria, composed a work (now lost) entitled &#928;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957;, as
        well as various treatises on philosophy and philosophers
        (Eratosthenica, Bernhardy, p. 168, 187, 197; Suidas, v.
        &#7960;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962;). He had passed some time at Athens, had enjoyed the
        lessons and conversation of Zeno the Stoic, but expressed still
        warmer admiration of Arkesilaus and Ariston. He spoke in
        animated terms of Athens as the great centre of congregation for
        philosophers in his day. He had composed a treatise, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
        &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8182;&#957;: but Strabo describes him as mixing up other subjects
        with philosophy (Strabo, i. p. 15).</p>
    </div>
    <p>It would indeed be most extraordinary if, among the hundreds of
      authors whose works must have been specified in the Tables of
      Kallimachus as constituting the treasures of the Alexandrine
      Museum,<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_22" href="#Footnotev1_6_22"><span
          class="sp">22</span></a> the name of Plato had not been
      included. Moreover, the distribution of the Platonic compositions
      into Trilogies, pursuant to the analogy of the Didaskali&aelig; or
      dramatic records, may very probably have originated with
      Kallimachus; and may have been simply approved and continued,
      perhaps with some modifications, by Aristophanes. At least this
      seems more consonant to the language of Diogenes Laertius, than
      the supposition that Aristophanes was the first originator of it.

        About the number of books, or more properly of <i>rolls</i> (<i>volumina</i>),



        in the Alexandrine library, see the enquiries of Parthey, Das
        Alexandrinische Museum, p. 76-84. Various statements are made by
        ancient authors, some of them with very large numbers; and no
        certainty is attainable. Many rolls would go to form one book.

      <p>The magnitude of the library at Alexandria in the time of
        Eratosthenes, and the multitude of writings which he consulted

        Hipparchus (Strabo, ii. 69).</p>

    <p>If we look back to the first commencement of the Alexandrine
      Museum and library, we shall be still farther convinced that the
      works of Plato, complete as well as genuine, must have been
      introduced into it before the days of Kallimachus. Strabo
      expressly tells us that the first stimulus and example impelling
      the Ptolemies to found this museum and library, were furnished by
      the school of Aristotle and Theophrastus at <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page278" id="v1page278"></a>278</span>Athens.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_23" href="#Footnotev1_6_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
      I believe this to be perfectly true; and it is farther confirmed
      by the fact that the institution at Alexandria comprised the same
      constituent parts and arrangements, described by the same titles,
      as those which are applied to the Aristotelian and Platonic
      schools at Athens.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_24"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Though
      the terms library, museum, and lecture-room, have now become
      familiar, both terms and meaning were at that time alike novel.
      Nowhere, as far as we know, did there exist a known and fixed
      domicile, consecrated in perpetuity to these purposes, and to
      literary men who took interest therein. A special stimulus was
      needed to suggest and enforce the project on Ptolemy Soter. That
      stimulus was supplied by the Aristotelian school at Athens, which
      the Alexandrine institution was intended to copy: &#924;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; (with
      &#7952;&#958;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#945; and &#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, a covered portico with recesses and seats,
      and a walk adjacent), on a far larger scale and with more
      extensive attributions.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_25"

        We see from hence what there was peculiar in the Platonic and
        Aristotelian literary establishments. They included something
        consecrated, permanent, and intended more or less for public
        use. The collection of books was not like a private library,
        destined only for the proprietor and such friends as he might
        allow &#8212; nor was it like that of a bookseller, intended for sale
        and profit. I make this remark in regard to the Excursus of
        Bekker, in his Charikles, i. 206, 216, a very interesting note
        on the book-trade and libraries of ancient Athens. Bekker
        disputes the accuracy of Strabo&#8217;s statement that Aristotle was
        the first person at Athens who collected a library, and who
        taught the kings of Egypt to do the like. In the literal sense
        of the words Bekker is right. Other persons before Aristotle had
        collected books (though I think Bekker makes more of the
        passages which he cites than they strictly deserve); one example
        is the youthful Euthydemus in Xenophon, Memorab. iv. 2; and
        Bekker alludes justly to the remarkable passage in the Anabasis
        of Xenophon, about books exported to the Hellenic cities in the
        Euxine (Anabas. vii. 5, 14). There clearly existed in Athens
        regular professional booksellers; we see that the bookseller
        read aloud to his visitors a part of the books which he had to
        sell, in order to tempt them to buy, a feeble foreshadowing of
        the advertisements and reviews of the present day (Diogen. L.
        vii. 2). But there existed as yet nothing of the nature of the
        Platonic and Aristotelian &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, whereof the collection of
        books, varied, permanent, and intended for the use of inmates
        and special visitors, was one important fraction. In this sense
        it served as a model for Demetrius Phalereus and Ptolemy Soter
        in regard to Alexandria.</p>
      <p>Vitruvius (v. 11) describes the <i>exhedr&aelig;</i> as seats
        placed under a covered portico &#8212; &#8220;in quibus philosophi,
        rhetores, reliquique qui studiis delectantur, sedentes disputare

      To Theophrastus also, the philosophical successor of Aristotle,
      Ptolemy showed peculiar honour; inviting him by special message to
      come and establish himself at Alexandria, which invitation however

    <p>These favourable dispositions, on the part of the first Ptolemy,
      towards philosophy and the philosophers at Athens, appear to have
      been mainly instigated and guided by the Phalerean Demetrius: an
      Athenian citizen of good station, who enjoyed for ten years at
      Athens (while that city was subject to Kassander) full political
      ascendancy, but who was expelled about 307 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
      by the increased force of the popular party, seconded by the
      successful invasion of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page280"
          id="v1page280"></a>280</span>Demetrius
      Poliork&ecirc;t&ecirc;s. By these political events Demetrius
      Phalereus was driven into exile: a portion of which exile was
      spent at Thebes, but a much larger portion of it at Alexandria,
      where he acquired the full confidence of Ptolemy Soter, and
      retained it until the death of that prince in 285 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> While active in politics, and
      possessing rhetorical talent, elegant without being forcible &#8212;
      Demetrius Phalereus was yet more active in literature and
      philosophy. He employed his influence, during the time of his
      political power, to befriend and protect both Xenokrates the chief
      of the Platonic school, and Theophrastus the chief of the
      Aristotelian. In his literary and philosophical views he followed
      Theophrastus and the Peripatetic sect, and was himself among their
      most voluminous writers. The latter portion of his life was spent
      at Alexandria, in the service of Ptolemy Soter; after whose death,
      however, he soon incurred the displeasure of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
      and died, intentionally or accidentally, from the bite of an asp.<a

      organising head and political experience, with an erudition not
      inferior to Varro, regard being had to the stock of learning
      accessible &#8212; was eminently qualified for the task. It procured for
      him great importance with Ptolemy, and compensated him for that

        &#924;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; to Philadelphus in v. 203, where he is describing the
        acts of Philadelphus.&#8221; This is a mistake: the passage in
        Athen&aelig;us does not specify which of the two first Ptolemies
        was the founder: it is perfectly consistent with the supposition
        that Ptolemy Soter founded it. The same may be said about the
        passage cited by Mr. Clinton from Plutarch; that too does not
        determine between the two Ptolemies, which was the founder.
        Perizonius was in error (as Mr. Clinton points out) in affirming
        that the passage in Plutarch determined the foundation to the
        first Ptolemy: Mr. Clinton is in error by affirming that the
        passage in Athen&aelig;us determines it to the second. Mr.
        Clinton has also been misled by Vitruvius and Scaliger (p. 389),
        when he affirms that the library at Alexandria was not formed
        until after the library at Pergamus. Bernhardy (Grundriss der
        Griech. Litt., Part i. p. 359, 367, 369) has followed Mr.
        Clinton too implicitly in recognising Philadelphus as the
        founder: nevertheless he too admits (p. 366) that the
        foundations were laid by Ptolemy Soter, under the advice and
        assistance of Demetrius Phalereus. </p>
      <p>The earliest declared king of the Attalid family at Pergamus
        acquired the throne in 241 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The
        library at Pergamus could hardly have been commenced before his
        time: and it is his successor, Eumenes II. (whose reign began in
        197 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), who is mentioned as the
        great collector and adorner of the library at Pergamus. See
        Strabo, xiii. 624; Clinton, Fast. Hellen. App. 6, p. 401-403. It
        is plain that the library at Pergamus could hardly have been
        begun before the close of the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus in
        Egypt, by which time the library of Alexandria had already
        acquired great extension and renown.</p>

        Sueton. Jul. C&aelig;s. c. 44. Melissus, one of the Illustres
        Grammatici of Rome, undertook by order of Augustus, &#8220;curam
        ordinandarum bibliothecarum in Octavi&aelig; porticu&#8221;. (Sueton.
        De Illustr. Grammat. c. 21.) </p>
      <p>Cicero replies in the following terms to his brother Quintus,
        who had written to him, requesting advice and aid in getting
        together for his own use a collection of Greek and Latin books.
        &#8220;De bibliothec&acirc; tu&acirc; Gr&aelig;c&acirc;
        supplend&acirc;, libris commutandis, Latinis comparandis &#8212;
        vald&eacute; velim ista confici, pr&aelig;sertim cum ad meum
        quoque usum spectent. Sed ego, mihi ipsi ista per quem agam, non
        habeo. <i>Neque enim venalia sunt, qu&aelig; quidem placeant:
          et confici nisi per hominem et peritum et diligentem non
          possunt.</i> Chrysippo tamen imperabo, et cum Tyrannione
        loquar.&#8221; (Cic., Epist. ad Q. Fratr. iii. 4, 5.) </p>
      <p>Now the circulation of books was greatly increased, and the
        book trade far more developed, at Rome when this letter was
        written (about three centuries after Plato&#8217;s decease) than it
        was at Athens during the time of Demetrius Phalereus (320-300 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>). Yet we see the difficulty which
        the two brothers Cicero had in collecting a mere private library
        for use of the owner simply. <i>Good books, in a correct and
          satisfactory condition, were not to be had for money</i>: it
        was necessary to get access to the best MSS., and to have
        special copies made, neatly and correctly: and this could not be
        done, except under the superintendence of a laborious literary
        man like Tyrannion, by well taught slaves subordinate to him. </p>
      <p>We may understand, from this analogy, the far greater obstacles
        which the collectors of the Alexandrine museum and library must
        have had to overcome, when <i>they</i> began their work. No one
        could do it, except a practised literary man such as Demetrius
        Phalereus: nor even he, except by finding out the best MSS., and
        causing special copies to be made for the use of the library.
        Respecting the extent and facility of book-diffusion in the
        Roman world, information will be found in the late Sir George
        Cornewall Lewis&#8217;s <i>Enquiry into the Credibility of Early
          Roman History</i>, vol. i. p. 196, seqq.; also, in the fifth
        chapter of the work of Adolf Schmidt, <i>Geschichte der
          Denk-und Glaubens-Freiheit im ersten Jahrhunderte der
          Kaiser-herrschaft</i>, Berlin, 1847; lastly in a valuable
        review of Adolf Schmidt&#8217;s work by Sir George Lewis himself, in
        Fraser&#8217;s Magazine for April, 1862, pp. 432-439. Adolf Schmidt
        represents the multiplication and cheapness of books in that day
        as something hardly inferior to what it is now &#8212; citing many
        authorities for this opinion. Sir G. Lewis has shown, in my
        judgment most satisfactorily, that these authorities are
        insufficient, and that the opinion is incorrect: this might have
        been shown even more fully, if the review had been lengthened. I
        perfectly agree with Sir G. Lewis on the main question: yet I
        think he narrows the case on his own side too much, and that the
        number of copies of such authors as Virgil and Horace, in
        circulation at one time, cannot have been so small as he
        imagines.</p>

        to collect the library.</span></p>
    <p>We learn that the ardour of Demetrius Phalereus was unremitting,
      and that his researches were extended everywhere, to obtain for
      the new museum literary monuments from all countries within
      contemporary knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_34"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> This is
      highly probable: such universality of literary interest was
      adapted to the mixed and cosmopolitan character of the Alexandrine
      population. But Demetrius was a Greek, born about the time of
      Plato&#8217;s death (347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), and
      identified with the political, rhetorical, dramatic, literary, and
      philosophical, activity of Athens, in which he had himself taken a
      prominent part. To collect the memorials of Greek literature would
      be his first object, more especially such as Aristotle and
      Theophrastus possessed in their libraries. Without doubt he would
      procure the works of Homer and the other distinguished poets,
      epic, lyric, and dramatic, as well as the rhetors, orators,
      &amp;c. He probably would not leave out the works of the <i>viri
        Sokratici</i> (Antisthenes, Aristippus, &AElig;schines, &amp;c.)
      and the other philosophers (Demokritus, Anaxagoras, Parmenides,
      &amp;c.). But there are two authors, whose compositions he would
      most certainly take pains to obtain &#8212; Plato and Aristotle. These
      were the two commanding names of Grecian philosophy in that <span

        though he goes on to state much that is fabulous and apocryphal,
        respecting the incidents which preceded and accompanied the
        translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Josephus is also mistaken
        in connecting Demetrius Phalereus with Ptolemy Philadelphus.
        Demetrius Phalereus was disgraced, and died shortly after that
        prince&#8217;s accession. His time of influence was under Ptolemy
        Soter.</p>

        Aristotle were among the earliest acquisitions made by him for
        the library.</span></p>
    <p>Among all the books which would pass over to Alexandria as the
      earliest stock of the new library, I know nothing upon which we
      can reckon more certainly than upon the works of Plato.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_35" href="#Footnotev1_6_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a>
      For they were acquisitions not only desirable, but also easily
      accessible. The writings of Aristippus or Demokritus &#8212; of Lysias
      or Isokrates &#8212; might require to be procured (or good MSS. thereof,
      fit to be specially copied) at different places and from different
      persons, without any security that the collection, when purchased,
      would be either complete or altogether genuine. But the
      manuscripts of Plato and of Aristotle were preserved in their
      respective schools at Athens, the Academic and Peripatetic:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_36" href="#Footnotev1_6_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
      a collection complete as well as verifiable. Demetrius could
      obtain permission, from Theophrastus in the Peripatetic school,
      from Polemon or Krantor in the Academic school, to have these MSS.
      copied for him by careful and expert hands. The cost of such
      copying must doubtless have been considerable; amounting to a sum
      which few <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page284"
          id="v1page284"></a>284</span>private individuals would have
      been either able or willing to disburse. But the treasures of
      Ptolemy were amply sufficient for the purpose:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_37" href="#Footnotev1_6_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
      and when he once conceived the project of founding a museum in his
      new capital, a large outlay, incurred for transcribing from the
      best MSS. a complete and authentic collection of the works of
      illustrious authors, was not likely to deter him. We know from
      other anecdotes,<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_38" href="#Footnotev1_6_38"><span
          class="sp">38</span></a> what vast sums the <span

      Ptolemy spent, for the mere purpose of securing better and more
      authoritative MSS. of works which the Alexandrine library already
      possessed.</p>

        Stahr, in the second part of his work &#8220;Aristotelia,&#8221; combats and
        refutes with much pains the erroneous supposition, that there
        was no sufficient publication of the works of Aristotle, until
        after the time when Apellikon purchased the MSS. from the heirs
        of Neleus &#8212; <i>i.e.</i> <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 100.
        Stahr shows evidence to prove, that the works, at least many of
        the works, of Aristotle were known and studied before the year
        100 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>: that they were in the
        library at Alexandria, and that they were procured for that
        library by Demetrius Phalereus. Stahr says (Thl. ii. p. 59): &#8220;Is
        it indeed credible &#8212; is it even conceivable &#8212; that Demetrius,
        who recommended especially to his regal friend Ptolemy the study
        of the political works of the philosophers &#8212; that Demetrius, the
        friend both of the Aristotelian philosophy and of Theophrastus,
        should have left the works of the two greatest Peripatetic
        philosophers out of his consideration? May we not rather be sure
        that he would take care to secure their works, before all
        others, for his nascent library &#8212; if indeed he did not bring
        them with him when he came to Alexandria?&#8221; The question here put
        by Stahr (and farther insisted on by Ravaisson, Essai sur la
        M&eacute;taphysique d&#8217;Aristote, Introd. p. 14) is very
        pertinent: and I put the like question, with slight change of
        circumstances, respecting the works of Plato. Demetrius
        Phalereus was the friend and patron of Xenokrates, as well as of
        Theophrastus.</p>

        In respect to the Peripatetic school, this is true only during
        the lifetime of Theophrastus, who died 287 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        I have already mentioned that after the death of Theophrastus,
        the MSS. were withdrawn from Athens. But all the operations of
        Demetrius Phalereus were carried on during the lifetime of
        Theophrastus; much of them, probably, in concert with
        Theophrastus, whose friend and pupil he was. The death of
        Theophrastus, the death of Ptolemy Soter, and the discredit and
        subsequent death of Demetrius are separated only by an interval
        of two or three years.</p>

        We find interesting information, in the letters of Cicero,
        respecting the <i>librarii</i> or copyists whom he had in his
        service; and the still more numerous and effective band of <i>librarii</i>
        and <i>anagnost&aelig;</i>: (slaves, mostly home-born) whom his
        friend Atticus possessed and trained (Corn. Nep., Vit. Attici,
        c. 13). See Epist. ad Attic. xii. 6; xiii. 21-44; v. 12 seq. </p>
      <p>It appears that many of the compositions of Cicero were copied,
        prepared for publication, and published, by the <i>librarii</i>
        of Atticus: who, in the case of the <i>Academica</i>, incurred
        a loss, because Cicero &#8212; after having given out the work to be
        copied and published, and after progress had been made in doing
        this &#8212; thought fit to alter materially both the form and the
        speakers introduced (xiii. 13). In regard to the Oration pro
        Ligario, Atticus sold it well, and brought himself home
        (&#8220;Ligarianam pr&aelig;clar&eacute; vendidisti: posthac, quicquid
        scripsero, tibi pr&aelig;conium deferam,&#8221; xiii. 12). Cicero
        (xiii. 21) compares the relation of Atticus towards himself,
        with that of Hermod&ocirc;rus towards Plato, as expressed in the
        Greek verse, &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7961;&#961;&#956;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#962; [&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;]. (Suidas, s, v.
        &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7961;&#961;&#956;. &#7952;&#956;&#960;.)</p>
      <p>Private friends, such as Balbus and C&aelig;rellia (xiii. 21),
        considered it a privilege to be allowed to take copies of his
        compositions at their own cost, through <i>librarii</i>
        employed for the purpose. And we find Galen enumerating this
        among the noble and dignified ways for an opulent man to expend
        money, in a remarkable passage, &#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#963;&#949; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8048;

        Galen, Comm. ad Hippokrat. &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#962;, vol. xvii. p. 606, 607,
        ed. K&uuml;hn. </p>
      <p>Lykurgus, the contemporary of Demosthenes as an orator,
        conspicuous for many years in the civil and financial
        administration of Athens, caused a law to be passed, enacting
        that an official MS. should be made of the plays of
        &AElig;schylus, Sophokles, and Euripides. No permission was
        granted to represent any of these dramas at the Dionysiac
        festival, except upon condition that the applicant and the
        actors whom he employed, should compare the MS. on which they
        intended to proceed, with the official MS. in the hands of the
        authorised secretary. The purpose was to prevent arbitrary
        amendments or omissions in these plays, at the pleasure of
        &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#945;&#953;. </p>
      <p>Ptolemy Euergetes borrowed from the Athenians these public and
        official MSS. of &AElig;schylus, Sophokles, and Euripides on the
        plea that he wished to have exact copies of them taken at
        Alexandria, and under engagement to restore them as soon as this
        was done. He deposited with them the prodigious sum of fifteen
        talents, as a guarantee for the faithful restitution. When he
        got the MSS. at Alexandria, he caused copies of them to be taken
        on the finest paper. He then sent these copies to Athens,
        keeping the originals for the Alexandrine library; desiring the
        Athenians to retain the deposit of fifteen talents for
        themselves. Ptolemy Euergetes here pays, not merely the cost of
        the finest copying, but fifteen talents besides, for the
        possession of official MSS. of the three great Athenian
        tragedians; whose works in other manuscripts must have been in
        the library long before. </p>
      <p>Respecting these official MSS. of the three great tragedians,
        prepared during the administration and under the auspices of the
        rhetor Lykurgus, see Plutarch, Vit. X. Orator, p. 841, also
        Boeckh, Gr&aelig;c&aelig; Trag&#339;d. Principia, pp. 13-15. The time
        when Lykurgus caused this to be done, must have been nearly
        coincident with the decease of Plato, 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        See Boeckh, Staatshaushaltung der Athener, vol. i. p. 468, ii.
        p. 244; Welcker, Griech. Trag. iii. p. 908; Korn, De Publico
        &AElig;schyli, &amp;c., Exemplari, Lykurgo Auctore Confecto, p.
        6-9, Bonn, 1863. </p>
      <p>In the passage cited above from Galen, we are farther informed,
        that Ptolemy Euergetes caused inquiries to be made, from the
        masters of all vessels which came to Alexandria, whether there
        were any MSS. on board; if there were, the MSS. were brought to
        the library, carefully copied out, and the copies given to the
        owners; the original MSS. being retained in the library, and
        registered in a separate compartment, under the general head of
        &#932;&#8048; &#7952;&#954; &#960;&#955;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#957;, and with the name of the person from whom the
        acquisition had been made, annexed. Compare Wolf, Prolegg. ad
        Homerum, p. clxxv. These statements tend to show the care taken
        by the Alexandrine librarians, not only to acquire the best
        MSS., but also to keep good MSS. apart from bad, and to record
        the person and the quarter from which each acquisition had been
        made.</p>

        Ptolemies for procuring good MSS.</span></p>
    <p>We cannot doubt that Demetrius could obtain permission, if he
      asked it, from the Scholarchs, to have such copies made. To them
      the operation was at once complimentary and lucrative; while among
      the Athenian philosophers generally, the name of Demetrius was
      acceptable, from the favour which he had shown to them during his
      season of political power &#8212; and that of Ptolemy popular from his
      liberalities. Or if we even suppose that Demetrius, instead of
      obtaining copies of the Platonic MSS. from the school, purchased
      copies from private persons or book-sellers (as he must have
      purchased the works of Demokritus and others) &#8212; he could, at any
      rate, assure himself of the authenticity of what he purchased, by
      information from the Scholarch. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_6_26"></a>Catalogue of Platonic works, prepared
        by Aristophanes, is trustworthy.</span></p>
    <p>My purpose, in thus calling attention to the Platonic school and
      the Alexandrine Museum, is to show that the chance for
      preservation of Plato&#8217;s works complete and genuine after his
      decease, was unusually favourable. I think that they existed
      complete and genuine in the Alexandrine Museum before the time of
      Kallimachus, and, of course, during that of Aristophanes. If there
      were in the Museum any other works obtained from private vendors
      and professing to be Platonic, Kallimachus and Aristophanes had
      the means of distinguishing these from such as the Platonic school
      had furnished and could authenticate, and motive enough for
      keeping them apart from the certified Platonic catalogue. Whether
      there existed any spurious works of this sort in the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page286" id="v1page286"></a>286</span>Museum,



      Diogenes Laertius does not tell us; nor, unfortunately, does he
      set forth the full list of those which Aristophanes, recognising
      as Platonic, distributed either in triplets or in units. Diogenes
      mentions only the principle of distribution adopted, and a select
      portion of the compositions distributed. But as far as his
      positive information goes, I hold it to be perfectly worthy of
      trust. I consider that all the compositions recognised by
      Aristophanes as works of Plato are unquestionably such; and that
      his testimony greatly strengthens our assurance for the received
      catalogue, in many of those items which have been most contested
      by critics, upon supposed internal grounds. Aristophanes
      authenticates, among others, not merely the Leges, but also the
      Epinomis, the Minos, and the Epistol&aelig;. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_6_27"
          id="Sidenotev1_6_27"></a>No canonical or exclusive order of
        the Platonic dialogues, when arranged by Aristophanes.</span></p>
    <p>There is another point also which I conceive to be proved by what
      we hear about Aristophanes. He (or Kallimachus before him)
      introduced a new order or distribution of his own &#8212; the Trilogies
      &#8212; founded on the analogy of the dramatic Didaskalies. This shows
      that the Platonic dialogues were not received into the library in
      any canonical or <i>exclusive order</i> of their own, or in any
      interdependence as first, second, third, &amp;c., essential to
      render them intelligible as a system. Had there been any such
      order, Kallimachus and Aristophanes would no more have altered it,
      than they would have transposed the order of the books in the
      Republic and Leges. The importance of what is here observed will
      appear presently, when we touch upon the theory of Schleiermacher.

        besides Alexandria, in which spurious Platonic works might get
        footing.</span></p>
    <p>The distributive arrangement, proposed or sanctioned by
      Aristophanes, applied (as I have already remarked) to the
      materials in the Alexandrine library only. But this library,
      though it was the most conspicuous portion, was not the whole, of
      the Grecian literary aggregate. There were other great regal
      libraries (such as those of the kings of Pergamus and the Seleukid
      kings<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_39" href="#Footnotev1_6_39"><span
          class="sp">39</span></a>) commenced after the Alexandrine
      library had already attained importance, and intended <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page287" id="v1page287"></a>287</span>to



      rival it: there was also an active literary and philosophising
      class, in various Grecian cities, of which Athens was the
      foremost, but in which Rhodes, Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc;, and several
      cities in Asia Minor, Kilikia, and Syria, were included:
      ultimately the cultivated classes at Rome, and the Western
      Hellenic city of Massalia, became comprised in the number. Among
      this widespread literary public, there were persons who neither
      knew nor examined the Platonic school or the Alexandrine library,
      nor investigated what title either of them had to furnish a
      certificate authenticating the genuine works of Plato. It is not
      certain that even the great library at Pergamus, begun nearly half
      a century after that of Alexandria, had any such initiatory agent
      as Demetrius Phalereus, able as well as willing to go to the
      fountain-head of Platonism at Athens: nor could the kings of
      Pergamus claim aid from Alexandria, with which they were in
      hostile rivalry, and from which they were even forbidden (so we
      hear) to purchase papyrus. Under these circumstances, it is quite
      possible that spurious Platonic writings, though they obtained no
      recognition in the Alexandrine library, might obtain more or less
      recognition elsewhere, and pass under the name of Plato. To a
      certain extent, such was the case. There existed some spurious
      dialogues at the time when Thrasyllus afterwards formed his
      arrangement. </p>

        The library of Antiochus the Great or of his predecessor, is
        mentioned by Suidas, &#917;&#8016;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#969;&#957;. Euphorion was librarian of it,
        seemingly about 230-220 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> See
        Clinton, Fast. Hell. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 221.</p>
      <p>Galen states (Comm. in Hippok. De Nat. Hom. vol. xv. p. 105,
        K&uuml;hn) that the forgeries of books, and the practice of
        tendering books for sale under the false names of celebrated
        authors, did not commence until the time when the competition
        between the kings of Egypt and the kings of Pergamus for their
        respective libraries became vehement. If this be admitted, there
        could have been no forgeries tendered at Alexandria until after
        the commencement of the reign of Euergetes (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        247-222): for the competition from Pergamus could hardly have
        commenced earlier than 230 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> In
        the times of Soter and Philadelphus, there would be no such
        forgeries tendered. I do not doubt that such forgeries were
        sometimes successfully passed <span class="correction"
          title="amended from 'of '">off</span>: but I think Galen does
        not take sufficient account of the practice (mentioned by
        himself) at the Alexandrine library, to keep faithful record of
        the person and quarter from whence each book had been acquired.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_6_29"></a>Other critics, besides Aristophanes,
        proposed different arrangements of the Platonic dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>Moreover the distribution made by Aristophanes of the Platonic
      dialogues into Trilogies, and the order of priority which he
      established among them was by no means universally accepted. Some
      rejected altogether the dramatic analogy of Trilogies as a
      principle of distribution. They arranged the dialogues <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page288" id="v1page288"></a>288</span>into



      three classes:<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_40" href="#Footnotev1_6_40"><span
          class="sp">40</span></a> 1. The Direct, or purely dramatic. 2.
      The Indirect, or narrative (diegematic). 3. The Mixed &#8212; partly
      one, partly the other. Respecting the order of priority, we read
      that while Aristophanes placed the Republic first, there were
      eight other arrangements, each recognising a different dialogue as
      first in order; these eight were, Alkibiades I., Theag&ecirc;s,
      Euthyphron, Kleitophon, Tim&aelig;us, Ph&aelig;drus,
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Apology. More than one arrangement began
      with the Apology. Some even selected the Epistol&aelig; as the
      proper commencement for studying Plato&#8217;s works.<a

        Diog. L. iii. 49. Sch&ouml;ne, in his commentary on the
        Protagoras (pp. 8-12), lays particular stress on this division
        into the direct or dramatic, and indirect or diegematic. He
        thinks it probable, that Plato preferred one method to the other
        at different periods of life: that all of one sort, and all of
        the other sort, come near together in time.</p>

        example of a Platonic dialogue disallowed upon internal grounds.</span></p>
    <p>We hear with surprise that the distinguished Stoic philosopher at
      Athens, Pan&aelig;tius, rejected the Ph&aelig;don as not being the
      work of Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_42" href="#Footnotev1_6_42"><span
          class="sp">42</span></a> It appears that he did not believe in
      the immortality of the soul, and that he profoundly admired Plato;
      accordingly, he thought it unworthy of so great a philosopher <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page289" id="v1page289"></a>289</span>to



      waste so much logical subtlety, poetical metaphor, and fable, in
      support of such a conclusion. Probably he was also guided, in
      part, by one singularity in the Ph&aelig;don: it is the only
      dialogue wherein Plato mentions himself in the third person.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_43" href="#Footnotev1_6_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
      If Pan&aelig;tius was predisposed, on other grounds, to consider
      the dialogue as unworthy of Plato, he might be induced to lay
      stress upon such a singularity, as showing that the author of the
      dialogue must be some person other than Plato. Pan&aelig;tius
      evidently took no pains to examine the external attestations of
      the dialogue, which he would have found to be attested both by
      Aristotle and by Kallimachus as the work of Plato. Moreover,
      whatever any one may think of the cogency of the reasoning &#8212; the
      beauty of Platonic handling and expression is manifest throughout
      the dialogue. This verdict of Pan&aelig;tius is the earliest
      example handed down to us of a Platonic dialogue disallowed on
      internal grounds that is, because it appeared to the critic
      unworthy of Plato: and it is certainly among the most unfortunate
      examples. </p>

        witnesses did not mean to assert that Pan&aelig;tius had
        declared the Ph&aelig;don to be spurious. One of the reasons
        urged by Wyttenbach is &#8212; &#8220;Nec illud negligendum, quod dicitur
        &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#928;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962;, &agrave; <i>Pan&aelig;tio quodam</i> neque
        per contemptum dici potuisse neque a Syriano neque ab hoc
        anonymo; quorum neuter e&acirc; fuit doctrin&aelig; inopia, ut
        Pan&aelig;tii laudes et pr&aelig;stantiam ignoraret.&#8221; But in the
        Scholion of Asklepius on the Metaphysica (which passage was not
        before Wyttenbach), we find the very same expression &#928;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#962;
        &#964;&#953;&#962;, and plainly used <i>per contemptum</i>: for Asklepius
        probably considered it a manifestation of virtuous feeling to
        describe, in contemptuous language, a philosopher who did not
        believe in the immortality of the soul. We have only to read the
        still harsher and more contemptuous language which he employs
        towards the Manicheans, in another Scholion, p. 666, b. 5,
        Brandis. </p>
      <p>Favorinus said (Diog. iii. 37) that when Plato read aloud the
        Ph&aelig;don, Aristotle was the only person present who remained
        to the end: all the other hearers went away in the middle. I
        have no faith in this anecdote: I consider it, like so many
        others in Diogenes, as a myth: but the invention of it
        indicates, that there were many persons who had no sympathy with
        the Ph&aelig;don, taking at the bottom the same view as
        Pan&aelig;tius.</p>

    <p>But the most elaborate classification of the Platonic works was
      that made by Thrasyllus, in the days of Augustus or Tiberius, near
      to, or shortly after, the Christian era: a rhetor of much
      reputation, consulted and selected as travelling companion by the
      Emperor Augustus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_44" href="#Footnotev1_6_44"><span

        B.</p>
      <p>It appears that this classification by Thrasyllus was approved,
        or jointly constructed, by his contemporary Derkyllides.
        (Albinus, &#917;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#8052;, c. 4, p. 149, in K. F. Hermann&#8217;s Appendix
        Platonica.)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Thrasyllus adopted two different distributions of the Platonic
      works: one was dramatic, the other philosophical. The two were
      founded on perfectly distinct principles, and had no inherent
      connection with each other; but Thrasyllus combined them together,
      and noted, in regard to each dialogue, its place in the one
      classification as well as in the other. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_6_32"
          id="Sidenotev1_6_32"></a>Dramatic principle &#8212; Tetralogies.</span></p>
    <p>One of these distributions was into Tetralogies, or groups of
      four each. This was in substitution for the Trilogies introduced
      by Aristophanes or by Kallimachus, and was founded upon the same
      dramatic analogy: the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page290"
          id="v1page290"></a>290</span> dramas, which contended for the
      prize at the Dionysiac festivals, having been sometimes exhibited
      in batches of three, or Trilogies, sometimes in batches of four,
      or Tetralogies &#8212; three tragedies, along with a satirical piece as
      accompaniment. Because the dramatic writer brought forth four
      pieces at a birth, it was assumed as likely that Plato would
      publish four dialogues all at once. Without departing from this
      dramatic analogy, which seems to have been consecrated by the
      authority of the Alexandrine Grammatici, Thrasyllus gained two
      advantages. First, he included <span class="smcap">ALL</span> the
      Platonic compositions, whereas Aristophanes, in his Trilogies, had
      included only a part, and had left the rest not grouped.
      Thrasyllus included all the Platonic compositions, thirty-six in
      number, reckoning the Republic, the Leges, and the Epistol&aelig;
      in bulk, each as one &#8212; in nine Tetralogies or groups of four each.
      Secondly, he constituted his first tetralogy in an impressive and
      appropriate manner &#8212; Euthyphron, Apology, Kriton, Ph&aelig;don &#8212;
      four compositions really resembling a dramatic tetralogy, and
      bound together by their common bearing, on the last scenes of the
      life of a philosopher.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_45"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> In
      Euthyphron, Sokrates appears as having been just indicted and as
      thinking on his defence; in the Apology, he makes his defence; in
      the Kriton, he appears as sentenced by the legal tribunal, yet
      refusing to evade the sentence by escaping from his prison; in the
      Ph&aelig;don, we have the last dying scene and conversation. None
      of the other tetralogies present an equal bond of connection
      between <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page291" id="v1page291"></a>291</span>their



      constituent items; but the first tetralogy was probably intended
      to recommend the rest, and to justify the system.</p>

      <p>Thrasyllus appears to have considered the Republic as ten
        dialogues and the Leges as twelve, each book (of Republic and of
        Leges) constituting a separate dialogue, so that he made the
        Platonic works fifty-six in all. But for the purpose of his

      Plato was regarded not as a quasi-dramatist, but as a philosopher.
      The dialogues were classified with reference partly to their
      method and spirit, partly to their subject. His highest generic
      distinction was into:&#8212;1. Dialogues of Investigation or Search. 2.
      Dialogues of Exposition or Construction. The Dialogues of
      Investigation he subdivided into two classes:&#8212;1. Gymnastic. 2.
      Agonistic. These were again subdivided, each into two sub-classes;
      the Gymnastic, into 1. Obstetric. 2. Peirastic. The Agonistic,
      into 1. Probative. 2. Refutative. Again, the Dialogues of
      Exposition were divided into two classes: 1. Theoretical. 2.
      Practical. Each of these classes was divided into two sub-classes:
      the Theoretical into 1. Physical. 2. Logical. The Practical into
      1. Ethical. 2. Political. </p>

            id="Footnotev1_6_46"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv1_6_46">46</a></span>
        The statement in Diogenes Laertius, in his life of Plato, is
        somewhat obscure and equivocal; but I think it certain that the
        classification which he gives in iii. 49, 50, 51, of the
        Platonic dialogues, was made by Thrasyllus. It is a portion of
        the same systematic arrangement as that given somewhat farther
        on (iii. 56-61), which is ascribed by name to Thrasyllus,
        enumerating the Tetralogies. Diogenes expressly states that
        Thrasyllus was the person who annexed to each dialogue its
        double denomination, which it has since borne in the published
        editions &#8212; &#917;&#8016;&#952;&#973;&#966;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#8212; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8001;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#8212; &#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;. In the Dialogues
        of examination or Search, one of these names is derived from the
        subject, the other from the method, as in the instance of
        Euthyphron just cited: in the Dialogues of Exposition both names
        are derived from the subject, first the special, next the
        general. &#934;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#969;&#957;, &#7970; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962;, &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;. &#928;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#948;&#951;&#962;, &#7970; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8182;&#957;,
        &#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;.</p>
      <p>Schleiermacher (in the Einleitung prefixed to his translation
        of Plato, p. 24) speaks somewhat loosely about &#8220;the well-known
        dialectical distributions of the Platonic dialogues, which
        Diogenes has preserved without giving the name of the author&#8221;.
        Diogenes gives only <i>one</i> such dialectical (or logical)
        distribution; and though he does not mention the name of
        Thrasyllus in direct or immediate connection with it, we may
        clearly see that he is copying Thrasyllus. This is well pointed
        out in an acute commentary on Schleiermacher, by Yxem, Logos
        Protreptikos, Berlin, 1841, p. 12-13. </p>
      <p>Diogenes remarks (iii. 50) that the distribution of the
        dialogues into narrative, dramatic, and mixed, is made &#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;
        &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7970; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#969;&#962;. This remark would seem to apply more
        precisely to the arrangement of the dialogues into trilogies and
        tetralogies. His word &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#969;&#962; belongs very justly to the
        logical distribution of Thrasyllus, apart from the tetralogies.
      </p>
      <p>Porphyry tells us that Plotinus did not bestow any titles upon
        his own discourses. The titles were bestowed by his disciples;
        who did not always agree, but gave different titles to the same
        discourse (Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 4).</p>

    <p>The second Table, as it here stands, is given by Diogenes
      Laertius, and is extracted by him probably from the work of
      Thrasyllus, or from the edition of Plato as published by
      Thrasyllus. The reader will see that each Platonic composition has
      a place assigned to it in two classifications &#8212; 1. The dramatic &#8212;
      2. The philosophical &#8212; each in itself distinct and independent of
      the other, but here blended together. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_6_34"
          id="Sidenotev1_6_34"></a>Incongruity and repugnance of the two
        classifications.</span></p>
    <p>We may indeed say more. The two classifications are not only
      independent, but incongruous and even repugnant. The better of the
      two is only obscurely and imperfectly apprehended, because it is
      presented as an appendage to the worse. The dramatic
      classification, which stands in the foreground, rests upon a
      purely fanciful analogy, determining preference for the number <i>four</i>.
      If indeed this objection were urged against Thrasyllus, he might
      probably have replied that the group of four volumes together was
      in itself convenient, neither too large nor too small, for an
      elementary subdivision; and that the fanciful analogy was an
      artifice for recommending it to the feelings, better (after all)
      than selection of another number by haphazard. Be that as it may,
      however, the fiction was one which Thrasyllus inherited from
      Aristophanes: and it does some honour to his ability, that he has
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page295" id="v1page295"></a>295</span>built,



      upon so inconvenient a fiction, one tetralogy (the first), really
      plausible and impressive.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_47"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> But it
      does more honour to his ability that he should have originated the
      philosophical classification; distinguishing the dialogues by
      important attributes truly belonging to each, and conducting the
      Platonic student to points of view which ought to be made known to
      him. This classification forms a marked improvement upon every
      thing (so far as we know) which preceded it. </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_6_47"
            id="Footnotev1_6_47"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv1_6_47">47</a></span>
        It is probable that Aristophanes, in distributing Plato into
        trilogies, was really influenced by the dramatic form of the
        compositions to put them in a class with real dramas. But
        Thrasyllus does not seem to have been influenced by such a
        consideration. He took the number <i>four</i> on its own
        merits, and adopted, as a way of recommending it, the
        traditional analogy sanctioned by the Alexandrine librarians.</p>
      <p>That such was the case, we may infer pretty clearly when we
        learn, that Thrasyllus applied the same distribution (into
        tetralogies) to the works of Demokritus, which were <i>not</i>
        dramatic in form. (Diog. L. ix. 45; Mullach, Democ. Frag. p.
        100-107, who attempts to restore the Thrasyllean tetralogies.) </p>
      <p>The compositions of Demokritus were not merely numerous, but
        related to the greatest diversity of subjects. To them
        Thrasyllus could not apply the same logical or philosophical
        distribution which he applied to Plato. He published, along with
        the works of Demokritus, a preface, which he entitled &#932;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
        &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#969;&#957; (Diog. L. ix. 41).</p>
      <p>Porphyry tells us, that when he undertook, as literary
        executor, the arrangement and publication of the works of his
        deceased master Plotinus, he found fifty-four discourses: which
        he arranged into six Enneads or groups of nine each. He was
        induced to prefer this distribution, by regard to the perfection
        of the number six (&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#953;). He placed in each Ennead
        discourses akin to each other, or on analogous subjects
        (Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 24).</p>

    <p>That Thrasyllus followed Aristophanes in the principle of his
      classification, is manifest: that he adopted the dramatic ground
      and principle of classification (while amending its details), not
      because he was himself guided by it, but because he found it
      already in use and sanctioned by the high authority of the
      Alexandrines &#8212; is also manifest, because he himself constructed
      and tacked to it a better classification, founded upon principles
      new and incongruous with the dramatic. In all this we trace the
      established ascendancy of the Alexandrine library and its eminent
      literati. Of which ascendancy a farther illustration appears, when
      we read in Diogenes Laertius that editions of Plato were
      published, carrying along with the text the special marks of
      annotation applied by the Alexandrines to Homer and other poets:
      the obelus to indicate a spurious passage, the obelus with two
      dots to denote a passage which had been improperly declared
      spurious, the X to signify peculiar locutions, the double line or
      Dipl&ecirc; to mark important or characteristic <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page296" id="v1page296"></a>296</span>opinions



      of Plato &#8212; and others in like manner. A special price was paid for
      manuscripts of Plato with these illustrative appendages:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_48" href="#Footnotev1_6_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
      which must have been applied either by Alexandrines themselves, or
      by others trained in their school. When Thrasyllus set himself to
      edit and re-distribute the Platonic works, we may be sure that he
      must have consulted one or more public libraries, either at
      Alexandria, Athens, Rome, Tarsus, or elsewhere. Nowhere else could
      he find all the works together. Now the proceedings ascribed to
      him show that he attached himself to the Alexandrine library, and
      to the authority of its most eminent critics. </p>

        then proceeds to enumerate the &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that Diogenes cites this statement
        (respecting the peculiar critical marks appended to manuscripts
        of the Platonic works) from Antigonus of Karystus in his Life of
        Zeno the Stoic. Now the date of Antigonus is placed by Mr. Fynes
        Clinton in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 225, before the
        death of Ptolemy III. Euergetes (see Fasti Hellen. <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> 225, also Appendix, 12, 80).
        Antigonus must thus have been contemporary both with Kallimachus
        and with Aristophanes of Byzantium: he notices the marked
        manuscripts of Plato as something newly edited &#8212; &#957;&#949;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#8054;
        &#7952;&#954;&#948;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#945;): and we may thus see that the work of critical
        marking must have been performed either by Kallimachus and
        Aristophanes themselves (one or both) or by some of their
        contemporaries. Among the titles of the lost treatises of
        Kallimachus, one is &#8212; about the &#947;&#955;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953; or peculiar phrases of
        Demokritus. It is therefore noway improbable that Kallimachus
        should have bestowed attention upon the peculiarities of the
        Platonic text, and the inaccuracies of manuscripts. The library
        had probably acquired several different manuscripts of the
        Platonic compositions, as it had of the Iliad and Odyssey, and
        of the Attic tragedies.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_6_37"
          id="Sidenotev1_6_37"></a>Thrasyllus followed the Alexandrine
        library and Aristophanes, as to genuine Platonic works.</span></p>
    <p>Probably it was this same authority that Thrasyllus followed in
      determining which were the real works of Plato, and in setting
      aside pretended works. He accepted the collection of Platonic
      compositions sanctioned by Aristophanes and recognised as such in
      the Alexandrine library. As far as our positive knowledge goes, it
      fully bears out what is here stated: all the compositions
      recognised by Aristophanes (unfortunately Diogenes does not give a
      complete enumeration of those which he recognised) are to be found
      in the catalogue of Thrasyllus. And the evidentiary value of this
      fact is so much the greater, because the most questionable
      compositions (I mean, those which modern critics reject or even
      despise) are expressly included in <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page297" id="v1page297"></a>297</span>the recognition
      of Aristophanes, and passed from him to Thrasyllus &#8212; Leges,
      Epinomis, Minos, Epistol&aelig;, Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus.
      Exactly on those points on which the authority of Thrasyllus
      requires to be fortified against modern objectors, it receives all
      the support which coincidence with Aristophanes can impart. When
      we know that Thrasyllus adhered to Aristophanes on so many
      disputable points of the catalogue, we may infer pretty certainly
      that he adhered to him in the remainder. In regard to the
      question, Which were Plato&#8217;s genuine works? it was perfectly
      natural that Thrasyllus should accept the recognition of the
      greatest library then existing: a library, the written records of
      which could be traced back to Demetrius Phalereus. He followed
      this external authority: he did not take each dialogue to pieces,
      to try whether it conformed to a certain internal standard &#8212; a
      &#8220;platonisches Gef&uuml;hl&#8221; &#8212; of his own. </p>

    <p>That the question between genuine and spurious Platonic dialogues
      was tried in the days of Thrasyllus, by external authority and not
      by internal feeling &#8212; we may see farther by the way in which
      Diogenes Laertius speaks of the spurious dialogues. &#8220;The following
      dialogues (he says) are declared to be spurious <i>by common
        consent</i>: 1. Eryxias or Erasistratus. 2. Akephali or
      Sisyphus. 3. Demodokus. 4. Axiochus. 5. Halkyon. 6. Midon or
      Hippotrophus. 7. Ph&aelig;akes. 8. Chelidon. 9. Hebdom&ecirc;. 10.
      Epimenides.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_49" href="#Footnotev1_6_49"><span
          class="sp">49</span></a> There was, then, unanimity, so far as
      the knowledge of Diogenes Laertius reached, as to genuine and
      spurious. All the critics whom he valued, Thrasyllus among them,
      pronounced the above ten dialogues to be spurious: all of them
      agreed also in accepting the dialogues in the list of Thrasyllus
      as genuine.<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_50" href="#Footnotev1_6_50"><span
          class="sp">50</span></a> Of course the ten spurious dialogues
      must have been talked of by some persons, or must have got footing
      in some editions or libraries, as real works of Plato: otherwise
      there could have been no trial had or sentence passed upon them. <span

      what Diogenes affirms is, that Thrasyllus and all the critics
      whose opinion he esteemed, concurred in rejecting them. We may
      surely presume that this unanimity among the critics, both as to
      all that they accepted and all that they rejected, arose from
      common acquiescence in the authority of the Alexandrine library.<a

        It has been contended by some modern critics, that Thrasyllus
        himself doubted whether the Hipparchus was Plato&#8217;s work. When I
        consider that <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#ch14Ap">dialogue</a>, I

        Diogenes (ix. 49) uses the same phrase in regard to the spurious
        works ascribed to Demokritus, &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8217; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957;
        &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;. And I believe that he means the same thing by it: that
        the works alluded to were not recognised in the Alexandrine
        library as belonging to Demokritus, and were accordingly
        excluded from the tetralogies (of Demokritus) prepared by
        Thrasyllus.</p>
    </div>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_6_39"
          id="Sidenotev1_6_39"></a>Thrasyllus did not follow an internal
        sentiment of his own in rejecting dialogues as spurious.</span></p>
    <p>If Thrasyllus and the others did not proceed upon this evidence
      in rejecting the ten dialogues, and did not find in them any marks
      of time such as to exclude the supposition of Platonic authorship
      &#8212; they decided upon what is called internal evidence: a critical
      sentiment, which satisfied them that these dialogues did not
      possess the Platonic character, style, manner, doctrines, merits,
      &amp;c. Now I think it highly improbable that Thrasyllus could
      have proceeded upon any such sentiment. For when we survey the
      catalogue of works which he recognised as genuine, we see that it
      includes the widest diversity of style, manner, doctrine, purpose,
      and merits: that the disparate epithets, which he justly applies
      to discriminate the various dialogues, cannot be generalised so as
      to leave any intelligible &#8220;Platonic character&#8221; common to all. Now
      since Thrasyllus reckoned among the genuine works of Plato,
      compositions so unlike, and so unequal in merit, as the Republic,
      Protagoras, Gorgias, Lysis, Parmenid&ecirc;s, Symposion,
      Phil&ecirc;bus, Menexenus, Leges, Epinomis, Hipparchus, Minos,
      Theag&ecirc;s, Epistol&aelig;, &amp;c., not to mention a
      composition obviously unfinished, such as the Kritias &#8212; he could
      have little scruple in believing that Plato also composed the
      Eryxias, Sisyphus, Demodokus, and Halkyon. These last-mentioned
      dialogues still exist, and can be appreciated.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_6_52" href="#Footnotev1_6_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
      Allowing, for the sake of argument, that we are entitled <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page299" id="v1page299"></a>299</span>to



      assume our own sense of worth as a test of what is really Plato&#8217;s
      composition, it is impossible to deny, that if these dialogues are
      not worthy of the author of Republic and Protagoras, they are at
      least worthy of the author of the Leges, Epinomis, Hipparchus,
      Minos, &amp;c. Accordingly, if the internal sentiment of
      Thrasyllus did not lead him to reject these last four, neither
      would it lead him to reject the Eryxias, Sisyphus, and Halkyon. I
      conclude therefore that if he, and all the other critics whom
      Diogenes esteemed, agreed in rejecting the ten dialogues as
      spurious &#8212; their verdict depended not upon any internal sentiment,
      but upon the authority of the Alexandrine library.<a

        The Axiochus, Eryxias, Sisyphus, and Demodokus, are printed as
        Apocrypha annexed to most editions of Plato, together with two
        other dialogues entitled De Justo and De Virtute. The Halkyon
        has generally appeared among the works of Lucian, but K. F.
        Hermann has recently printed it in his edition of Plato among
        the Platonic Apocrypha.</p>
      <p>The Axiochus contains a mark of time (the mention of &#7944;&#954;&#945;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#943;&#945;
        and &#923;&#965;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, p. 367), as F. A. Wolf has observed, proving that
        it was not composed until the Platonic and Peripatetic schools
        were both of them in full establishment at Athens &#8212; that is,
        certainly after the death of Plato, and probably after the death
        of Aristotle. It is possible that Thrasyllus may have proceeded
        upon this evidence of time, at least as collateral proof, in
        pronouncing the dialogue not to be the work of Plato. The other
        four dialogues contain no similar evidence of date.</p>
      <p>Favorinus affirmed that Halkyon was the work of an author named
        Leon. </p>
      <p>Some said (Diog. L. iii. 37) that Philippus of Opus, one of the
        disciples of Plato, transcribed the Leges, which were on waxen
        tablets (&#7952;&#957; &#954;&#951;&#961;&#8183;), and that the Epinomis was his work (&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#8050;
        &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#948;&#945; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;). It was probably the work of
        Philippus only in the sense in which the Leges were his work &#8212;
        that he made a fair and durable copy of parts of it from the
        wax. Thrasyllus admitted it with the rest as Platonic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_6_53"

        Mullach (Democr. Fragm. p. 100) accuses Thrasyllus of an entire
        want of critical sentiment, and pronounces his catalogue to be
        altogether without value as an evidence of genuine Platonic
        works &#8212; because Thrasyllus admits many dialogues, &#8220;quos doctorum
        nostri s&aelig;culi virorum acumen &egrave; librorum
        Platonicorum numero exemit&#8221;. </p>
      <p>This observation exactly illustrates the conclusion which I
        desire to bring out. I admit that Thrasyllus had a critical
        sentiment different from that of the modern Platonic
        commentators; but I believe that in the present case he
        proceeded upon other evidence &#8212; recognition by the Alexandrine
        library. My difference with Mullach is, that I consider this
        recognition (in a question of genuine or spurious) as more
        trustworthy evidence than the critical sentiment of modern
        literati.</p>

    <p>On this question, then, of the Canon of Plato&#8217;s works (as
      compared with the works of other contemporary authors) recognised
      by Thrasyllus &#8212; I consider that its claim to trustworthiness is
      very high, as including all the genuine works, and none but the
      genuine works, of Plato: the following facts being either proved,
      or fairly presumable. </p>
    <p>1. The Canon rests on the authority of the Alexandrine library
      and its erudite librarians;<a name="FnAnchorv1_6_54"
        href="#Footnotev1_6_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> whose
      written records went <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page300"
          id="v1page300"></a>300</span>back to the days of Ptolemy
      Soter, and Demetrius Phalereus, within a generation after the
      death of Plato. </p>
    <p>2. The manuscripts of Plato at his death were preserved in the
      school which he founded; where they continued for more than thirty
      years under the care of Speusippus and Xenokrates, who possessed
      personal knowledge of all that Plato had really written. After
      Xenokrates, they came under the care of Polemon and the succeeding
      Scholarchs, from whom Demetrius Phalereus probably obtained
      permission to take copies of them for the nascent museum or
      library at Alexandria or through whom at least (if he purchased
      from booksellers) he could easily ascertain which were Plato&#8217;s
      works, and which, if any, were spurious. </p>
    <p>3. They were received into that library without any known
      canonical order, prescribed system, or interdependence essential
      to their being properly understood. Kallimachus or Aristophanes
      devised an order of arrangement for themselves, such as they
      thought suitable. </p>

        Suckow adopts and defends the opinion here stated &#8212; that
        Thrasyllus, in determining which were the genuine works of Plato
        and which were not genuine, was guided mainly by the authority
        of the Alexandrine library and librarians (G. F. W. Suckow, Form
        der Platonischen Schriften, pp. 170-175). Ueberweg admits this
        opinion as just (Untersuchungen, p. 195).</p>
      <p>Suckow farther considers (p. 175) that the catalogue of works
        of esteemed authors, deposited in the Alexandrine library, may
        be regarded as dating from the &#928;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962; of Kallimachus. </p>
      <p>This goes far to make out the presumption which I have
        endeavoured to establish in favour of the Canon recognised by
        Thrasyllus, which, however, these two authors do not fully
        admit. </p>
      <p>K. F. Hermann, too (see Gesch. und Syst. der Platon. Philos. p.
        44), argues sometimes strongly in favour of this presumption,
        though elsewhere he entirely departs from it.</p>

        Ficinus and the succeeding critics after the revival of
        learning.</span></p>
    <p>The Platonic Canon established by Thrasyllus maintained its
      authority until the close of the last century, in regard to the
      distinction between what was genuine and spurious. The
      distribution indeed did not continue to be approved: the
      Tetralogies were neglected, and the order of the dialogues varied:
      moreover, doubts were intimated about Kleitophon and Epinomis. But
      nothing was positively removed from, or positively added to, the
      total recognised by Thrasyllus. The Neo-Platonists (from the close
      of the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, down to
      the beginning of the sixth <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>)
      introduced a new, mystic, and theological interpretation, which
      often totally changed and falsified Plato&#8217;s meaning. Their
      principles of interpretation would have been strange and
      unintelligible to the rhetors Thrasyllus and Dionysius of
      Halikarnassus &#8212; or to the Platonic philosopher Charmadas, who
      expounded Plato to Marcus Crassus at Athens. But they still
      continued to look for Plato in the nine Tetralogies of Thrasyllus,
      in each and all of them. So also continued Ficinus, who, during
      the last half of the fifteenth century, did so much to revive in
      the modern world the study of Plato. He revived along with it the
      neo-platonic interpretation. The Argumenta, prefixed to the
      different dialogues by Ficinus, are remarkable, as showing what an
      ingenious student, interpreting in that spirit, discovered in
      them. </p>
    <p>But the scholars of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
      centuries, speaking generally &#8212; though not neglecting these
      neo-platonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page302"
          id="v1page302"></a>302</span> refinements, were disposed to
      seek out, wherever they could find it, a more literal
      interpretation of the Platonic text, correctly presented and
      improved. The next great edition of the works of Plato was
      published by Serranus and Stephens, in the latter portion of the
      sixteenth century. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_2"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_2"></a>Serranus &#8212; his six Syzygies &#8212; left the
        aggregate Canon unchanged, Tennemann &#8212; importance assigned to
        the Ph&aelig;drus.</span></p>
    <p>Serranus distributed the dialogues of Plato into six groups which
      he called Syzygies. In his first Syzygy were comprised Euthyphron,
      Apologia, Kriton, Ph&aelig;don (coinciding with the first
      Tetralogy of Thrasyllus), as setting forth the defence of Sokrates
      and of his doctrine. The second Syzygy included the dialogues
      introductory to philosophy generally, and impugning the Sophists &#8212;
      Theag&ecirc;s, Erast&aelig;, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
      Sophist&ecirc;s, Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Protagoras, Hippias II. In the
      third Syzygy were three dialogues considered as bearing on Logic &#8212;
      Kratylus, Gorgias, Ion. The fourth Syzygy contained the dialogues
      on Ethics generally &#8212; Phil&ecirc;bus, Menon, Alkibiad&ecirc;s I.;
      on special points of Ethics &#8212; Alkibiad&ecirc;s II.,
      Charmid&ecirc;s, Lysis, Hipparchus; and on Politics &#8212; Menexenus,
      Politikus, Minos, Republic, Leges, Epinomis. The fifth Syzygy
      included the dialogues on Physics, and Metaphysics (or Theology) &#8212;
      Tim&aelig;us, Kritias, Parmenid&ecirc;s, Symposion, Ph&aelig;drus,
      Hippias <span class="correction" title="emended from 'II.'">I.</span>
      In the sixth Syzygy were ranged the thirteen Epistles, the various
      dialogues which Serranus considered spurious (Kleitophon among
      them, which he regarded as doubtful), and the Definitions. </p>
    <p>Serranus, while modifying the distribution of the Platonic works,
      left the entire Canon very much as he found it. So it remained
      throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: the scholars
      who devoted themselves to Plato were content with improvement of
      the text, philological illustration, and citations from the
      ancient commentators. But the powerful impulse, given by Kant to
      the speculative mind of Europe during the last quarter of the
      eighteenth century, materially affected the point of view from
      which Plato was regarded. Tennemann, both in his System of the
      Platonic Philosophy, and in dealing with Plato as a portion of his
      general history of philosophy, applied the doctrines of Kant
      largely and even excessively to the exposition of ancient
      doctrines. Much of his comment is instructive, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page303" id="v1page303"></a>303</span>greatly



      surpassing his predecessors. Without altering the Platonic Canon,
      he took a new view of the general purposes of Plato, and
      especially he brought forward the dialogue Ph&aelig;drus into a
      prominence which had never before belonged to it, as an index or
      key-note (&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;) to the whole Platonic series. Shortly after
      Tennemann, came Schleiermacher, who introduced a theory of his
      own, ingenious as well as original, which has given a new turn to
      all the subsequent Platonic criticism. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_3"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_3"></a>Schleiermacher &#8212; new theory about the
        purposes of Plato. One philosophical scheme, conceived by Plato
        from the beginning &#8212; essential order and interdependence of the
        dialogues, as contributing to the full execution of this scheme.
        Some dialogues not constituent items in the series, but lying
        alongside of it. Order of arrangement.</span></p>
    <p>Schleiermacher begins by assuming two fundamental postulates,
      both altogether new. 1. A systematic unity of philosophic theme
      and purpose, conceived by Plato in his youth, at first obscurely &#8212;
      afterwards worked out through successive dialogues; each dialogue
      disclosing the same purpose, but the later disclosing it more
      clearly and fully, until his old age. 2. A peremptory, exclusive,
      and intentional order by Plato of the dialogues, composed by Plato
      with a view to the completion of this philosophical scheme.
      Schleiermacher undertakes to demonstrate what this order was, and
      to point out the contribution brought by each successive dialogue
      to the accomplishment of Plato&#8217;s premeditated scheme. </p>
    <p>To those who understand Plato, the dialogues themselves reveal
      (so Schleiermacher affirms) their own essential order of sequence
      &#8212; their own mutual relations of antecedent and consequent. Each
      presupposes those which go before: each prepares for those which
      follow. Accordingly, Schleiermacher distributes the Platonic
      dialogues into three groups: the first, or elementary, beginning
      with Ph&aelig;drus, followed by Lysis, Protagoras, Lach&ecirc;s,
      Charmid&ecirc;s, Euthyphron, Parmenid&ecirc;s: the second, or
      preparatory, comprising Gorgias, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Menon,
      Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Kratylus, Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, Symposion,
      Ph&aelig;don, Phil&ecirc;bus: the third, or constructive,
      including Republic, Tim&aelig;us, and Kritias. These groups or
      files are all supposed to be marshalled under Platonic authority:
      both the entire files as first, second, third and the dialogues
      composing each file, carrying their own place in the order,
      imprinted in visible characters. But to each file, there is
      attached what <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page304"
          id="v1page304"></a>304</span> Schleiermacher terms an
      Appendix, containing one or more dialogues, each a composition by
      itself, and lying not in the series, but alongside of it
      (Nebenwerke). The Appendix to the first file includes Apologia,
      Kriton, Ion, Hippias II., Hipparchus, Minos, Alkibiad&ecirc;s II.
      The Appendix to the second file consists of Theag&ecirc;s,
      Erast&aelig;, Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., Menexenus, Hippias I.,
      Kleitophon. That of the third file consists of the Leges. The
      Appendix is not supposed to imply any common positive character in
      the dialogues which it includes, but simply the negative attribute
      of not belonging to the main philosophical column, besides a
      greater harmony with the file to which it is attached than with
      the other two files. Some dialogues assigned to the Appendixes are
      considered by Schleiermacher as spurious; some however he treats
      as compositions on special occasions, or adjuncts to the regular
      series. To this latter category belong the Apologia, Kriton, and
      Leges. Schleiermacher considers the Charmid&ecirc;s to have been
      composed during the time of the Anarchy, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      404: the Ph&aelig;drus (earliest of all), in Olymp. 93 (<span

        of any preconceived scheme &#8212; considers the dialogues as distinct
        philosophical dramas.</span></p>
    <p>Such is the general theory of Schleiermacher, which presents to
      us Plato in the character of a Demiurgus, contemplating from the
      first an Idea of philosophy, and constructing a series of
      dialogues (like a Kosmos of Schleiermacher), with the express
      purpose of giving embodiment to it as far as practicable. We next
      come to Ast, who denies this theory altogether. According to Ast,
      there never was any philosophical system, to the exposition and
      communication of which each successive dialogue was deliberately
      intended to contribute: there is no scientific or intentional
      connection between the dialogues, &#8212; no progressive arrangement of
      first and second, of foundation and superstructure: there is no
      other unity or connecting principle between them than that which
      they involve as all emanating from the same age, country, and
      author, and the same general view of the world (Welt-Ansicht) or
      critical estimate of man and nature.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_2"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The
      dialogues<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page305" id="v1page305"></a>305</span>
      are dramatic (Ast affirms), not merely in their external form, but
      in their internal character: each is in truth a philosophical
      drama.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_3" href="#Footnotev1_7_3"><span
          class="sp">3</span></a> Their purpose is very diverse and
      many-sided: we mistake if we imagine the philosophical purpose to
      stand alone. If that were so (Ast argues), how can we explain the
      fact, that in most of the dialogues there is no philosophical
      result at all? Nothing but a discussion without definite end,
      which leaves every point unsettled.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_4"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Plato is
      poet, artist, philosopher, blended in one. He does not profess to
      lay down positive opinions. Still less does he proclaim his own
      opinions as exclusive orthodoxy, to be poured ready-prepared into
      the minds of recipient pupils. He seeks to urge the pupils to
      think and investigate for themselves. He employs the form of
      dialogue, as indispensable to generate in their minds this impulse
      of active research, and to arm them with the power of pursuing it
      effectively.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_5" href="#Footnotev1_7_5"><span
          class="sp">5</span></a> But each Platonic dialogue is a
      separate composition in itself, and each of the greater dialogues

        The general view here taken by Ast &#8212; dwelling upon the separate
        individuality as well as upon the dramatic character of each
        dialogue &#8212; calling attention to the purpose of intellectual
        stimulation, and of reasoning out different aspects of ethical
        and dialectical questions, as distinguished from endoctrinating
        purpose &#8212; this general view coincides more nearly with my own
        than that of any other critic. But Ast does not follow it out
        consistently. If he were consistent with it, he ought to be more
        catholic than other critics, in admitting a large and
        undefinable diversity in the separate Platonic manifestations:
        instead of which, he is the most sweeping of all repudiators, on
        internal grounds. He is not even satisfied with the Parmenides
        as it now stands; he insists that what is now the termination
        was not the real and original termination; but that Plato must
        have appended to the dialogue an explanation of its &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;,
        puzzles, and antinomies; which explanation is now lost.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_7_5"></a>His order of arrangement. He admits
        only fourteen dialogues as genuine, rejecting all the rest.</span></p>
    <p>Though Ast differs thus pointedly from Schleiermacher in the
      enunciation of his general principle, yet he approximates to him
      more nearly when he comes to detail: for he recognises three
      classes of dialogues, succeeding each other in a chronological
      order verifiable (as he thinks) by the dialogues themselves. His
      first class (in which he declares the poetical and dramatic
      element to be predominant) consists of Protagoras, Ph&aelig;drus,
      Gorgias, Ph&aelig;don. His second class, distinguished by the
      dialectic element, includes The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
      Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, Parmenid&ecirc;s, Kratylus. His third
      class, wherein the poetical and dialectic <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page306" id="v1page306"></a>306</span> element are
      found both combined, embraces Phil&ecirc;bus, Symposion, Republic,
      Tim&aelig;us, Kritias. These fourteen dialogues, in Ast&#8217;s view,
      constitute the whole of the genuine Platonic works. All the rest
      he pronounces to be spurious. He rejects Leges, Epinomis, Menon,
      Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, Lysis, Alkibiades
      I. and II., Hippias I. and II., Ion, Erast&aelig;, Theages,
      Kleitophon, Apologia, Kriton, Minos, Epistol&aelig; &#8212; together
      with all the other dialogues which were rejected in antiquity by
      Thrasyllus. Lastly, Ast considers the Protagoras to have been
      composed in 408 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when Plato was
      not more than 21 years of age &#8212; the Ph&aelig;drus in 407 <span

    <p>Socher agrees with Ast in rejecting the fundamental hypothesis of
      Schleiermacher &#8212; that of a preconceived scheme systematically
      worked out by Plato. But on many points he differs from Ast no
      less than from Schleiermacher. He assigns the earliest Platonic
      composition (which he supposes to be Theag&ecirc;s), to a date
      preceding the battle of Arginus&aelig;, in 406 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when Plato was about 22-23 years of
      age.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_8" href="#Footnotev1_7_8"><span
          class="sp">8</span></a> Assuming it is certain that Plato
      composed dialogues during the lifetime of Sokrates, he conceives
      that the earliest of them would naturally be the most purely
      Sokratic in respect of theme, as well as the least copious,
      comprehensive, and ideal, in manner of handling. During the six
      and a half years between the battle of Arginus&aelig; and the
      death of Sokrates, Socher registers the following succession of
      Platonic compositions: Theag&ecirc;s, Lach&ecirc;s, Hippias II.,
      Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., Dialogus de Virtute (usually printed with the
      spurious, but supposed by Socher to be a sort of preparatory
      sketch for the Menon), Menon, Kratylus, Euthyphron. These three
      last he supposes to precede very shortly the death of Sokrates.
      After that event, and very shortly after, were composed the
      Apologia, Kriton, and Ph&aelig;don. </p>

      of his teaching at the Academy, when about 41 or 42 years old (<span

      theory is, that he rejects as spurious Parmenid&ecirc;s,
      Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, Kritias.</p>

    <p>From Schleiermacher, Ast, and Socher, we pass to K. F. Hermann<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_10" href="#Footnotev1_7_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
      &#8212; and to Stallbaum, who has prefixed Prolegomena to his edition of
      each dialogue. Both these critics protest against Socher&#8217;s
      rejection of the four dialogues last indicated: but they agree
      with Socher and Ast in denying the reality of any preconceived
      system, present to Plato&#8217;s mind in his first dialogue, and
      advanced by regular steps throughout each of the succeeding
      dialogues. The polemical tone of K. F. Hermann against this
      theory, and against Schleiermacher, its author, is strenuous and
      even unwarrantably bitter.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_11"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
      Especially the position laid <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page308" id="v1page308"></a>308</span>down by
      Schleiermacher &#8212; that Ph&aelig;drus is the earliest of Plato&#8217;s
      dialogues, written when he was 22 or 23 years of age, and that the
      general system presiding over all the future dialogues is
      indicated therein as even then present to his mind, afterwards to
      be worked out &#8212; is controverted by Hermann and Stallbaum no less
      than by Ast and Socher. All three concur in the tripartite
      distribution of the life of Plato. But Hermann thinks that Plato
      acquired gradually and successively, new points of view, with
      enlarged philosophical development: and that the dialogues as
      successively composed are expressions of these varying phases.
      Moreover, Hermann thinks that such variations in Plato&#8217;s
      philosophy may be accounted for by external circumstances. He
      reckons Plato&#8217;s first period as ending with the death of Sokrates,
      or rather at an epoch not long after the death of Sokrates: the
      second as ending with the commencement of Plato&#8217;s teaching at the
      Academy, after his return from Sicily &#8212; about 385 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>: the third, as extending from thence
      to his old age. To the first, or Sokratic stadium, Hermann assigns
      the smaller dialogues: the earliest of which he declares to be &#8212;
      Hippias II., Ion, Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., Lysis, Charmid&ecirc;s,
      Lach&ecirc;s: after which come Protagoras and Euthyd&ecirc;mus,
      wherein the batteries are opened against the Sophists, shortly
      before the death of Sokrates. Immediately after the last mentioned
      event, come a series of dialogues reflecting the strong and fresh
      impression left by it upon Plato&#8217;s mind &#8212; Apologia, Kriton,
      Gorgias, Euthyphron, Menon, Hippias I. &#8212; occupying a sort of
      transition stage between the first and the second period. We now
      enter upon the second or dialectic period; passed by Plato greatly
      at <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page309" id="v1page309"></a>309</span>Megara,



      and influenced by the philosophical intercourse which he there
      enjoyed, and characterised by the composition of
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Kratylus, Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus,
      Parmenid&ecirc;s.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_12" href="#Footnotev1_7_12"><span
          class="sp">12</span></a> To the third, or constructive period,
      greatly determined by the influence of the Pythagorean philosophy,
      belong Ph&aelig;drus, Menexenus, Symposion, Ph&aelig;don,
      Phil&ecirc;bus, Republic, Tim&aelig;us, Kritias: a series composed
      during Plato&#8217;s teaching at the Academy, and commencing with
      Ph&aelig;drus, which last Hermann considers to be a sort of
      (Antritts-Programme) inauguratory composition for the opening of
      his school of oral discourse or colloquy. Lastly, during the final
      years of the philosopher, after all the three periods, come the
      Leges or treatise de Legibus: placed by itself as the composition
      of his old age. </p>

        Ueberweg (Untersuchungen, pp. 50-52) has collected several
        citations from K. F. Hermann, in which the latter treats
        Schleiermacher &#8220;wie einen Sophisten, der sich in absichtlicher
        Unwahrhaftigkeit gefalle, mitunter fast als einen Mann der
        innerlich wohl wisse, wie die Sache stehe (n&auml;mlich, dass
        sie so sei, wie Hermann lehrt), der sich aber, etwa aus Lust,
        seine &uuml;berlegene Dialektik zu beweisen, M&uuml;he gebe, sie
        in einem anderen Lichte erscheinen zu lassen; also &#8212; &#964;&#959; &#7973;&#964;&#964;&#969;
        &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#964;&#964;&#969; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#8212; recht in rhetorisch sophistischer
        Manier.&#8221; </p>
      <p>We know well, from other and independent evidence, what
        Schleiermacher really was, that he was not only one of the most
        accomplished scholars, but one of the most liberal and estimable
        men of his age. But how different would be our appreciation if
        we had no other evidence to judge by except the dicta of
        opponents, and even distinguished opponents, like Hermann! If
        there be any point clear in the history of philosophy, it is the
        uncertainty of all judgments, respecting writers and thinkers,
        founded upon the mere allegations of opponents. Yet the Athenian
        Sophists, respecting whom we have no independent evidence
        (except the general fact that they had a number of approvers and
        admirers), are depicted confidently by the Platonic critics in
        the darkest colours, upon the evidence of their bitter opponent
        Plato &#8212; and in colours darker than even his evidence warrants.
        The often-repeated calumny, charged against almost all debaters
        &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7973;&#964;&#964;&#959; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#964;&#964;&#969; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#8212; by Hermann against
        Schleiermacher, by Mel&ecirc;tus against Sokrates, by Plato
        against the Sophists &#8212; is believed only against these last.</p>

        K. F. Hermann, Gesch. u. Syst. d. Plat. Phil., p. 496, seq.
        Stallbaum (p. xxxiii.) places the Kratylus during the lifetime
        of Sokrates, a little earlier than Euthyd&ecirc;mus and
        Protagoras, all three of which he assigns to Olymp. 94, 402-400
        <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> See also his Proleg. to
        Kratylus, tom. v. p. 26. </p>
      <p>Moreover, Stallbaum places the Menon and Ion about the same
        time &#8212; a few months or weeks before the trial of Sokrates
        (Proleg. ad Menonem, tom. vi. pp. 20, 21; Proleg. ad Ionem, tom.
        iv. p. 289). He considers the Euthyphron to have been actually
        composed at the moment to which it professes to refer (viz.,
        after Mel&ecirc;tus had preferred indictment against Sokrates),
        and with a view of defending Sokrates against the charge of
        impiety (Proleg. ad Euthyphron. tom. vi. pp. 138-139-142). He
        places the composition of the Charmid&ecirc;s about six years
        before the death of Sokrates (Proleg. ad Charm. p. 86). He seems
        to consider, indeed, that the Menon and Euthyd&ecirc;mus were
        both written for the purpose of defending Sokrates: thus
        implying that they too were written <i>after</i> the indictment
        was preferred (Proleg. ad Euthyphron. p. 145). </p>
      <p>In regard to the date of the Euthyphron, Schleiermacher also
        had declared, prior to Stallbaum, that it was <i>unquestionably</i>
        (unstreitig) composed at a period between the indictment and the
        trial of Sokrates (Einl. zum Euthyphron, vol. ii. p. 53, of his
        transl. of Plato).</p>

      Erast&aelig;, Hipparchus, Minos, Epinomis: Stallbaum rejects the

        rejects several.</span></p>
    <p>Steinhart, in his notes and prefaces to H. M&uuml;ller&#8217;s
      translation of the Platonic dialogues, agrees in the main with K.
      F. Hermann, both in denying the fundamental postulate of
      Schleiermacher, and in settling the general order of the
      dialogues, though with some difference as to individual dialogues.
      He considers Ion as the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page310"
          id="v1page310"></a>310</span>earliest, followed by Hippias I,
      Hippias II., Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., Lysis, Charmid&ecirc;s,
      Lach&ecirc;s, Protagoras. These constitute what Steinhart calls
      the ethico-Sokratical series of Plato&#8217;s compositions, having the
      common attributes &#8212; That they do not step materially beyond the
      philosophical range of Sokrates himself &#8212; That there is a
      preponderance of the mimic and plastic element &#8212; That they end, to
      all appearance, with unsolved doubts and unanswered questions.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_14" href="#Footnotev1_7_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
      He supposes the Charmid&ecirc;s to have been composed during the
      time of the Thirty, the Lach&ecirc;s shortly afterwards, and the
      Protagoras about two years before the death of Sokrates. He lays
      it down as incontestable that the Protagoras was not composed
      after the death of Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_15"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
      Immediately prior to this last-mentioned event, and posterior to
      the Protagoras, he places the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Menon, Euthyphron,
      Apologia, Kriton, Gorgias, Kratylus: preparatory to the dialectic
      series consisting of Parmenid&ecirc;s, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
      Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, the result of Plato&#8217;s stay at Megara,
      and contact with the Eleatic and Megaric philosophers. The third
      series of dialogues, the mature and finished productions of Plato
      at the Academy, opens with Ph&aelig;drus. Steinhart rejects as
      spurious Alkibiad&ecirc;s II., Erast&aelig;, Theag&ecirc;s,
      &amp;c. </p>

        degree with K. F. Hermann his order of arrangement.</span></p>
    <p>Another author, also, Susemihl, coincides in the main with the
      principles of arrangement adopted by K. F. Hermann for the
      Platonic dialogues. First in the order of chronological
      composition he places the shorter dialogues &#8212; the exclusively
      ethical, least systematic; and he ranges them in a series,
      indicating the progressive development of Plato&#8217;s mind, with
      approach towards his final systematic conceptions.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_16" href="#Footnotev1_7_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
      Susemihl begins this early series with Hippias II., followed by
      Lysis, Charmid&ecirc;s, Lach&ecirc;s, Protagoras, Menon, Apologia,
      Kriton, Gorgias, Euthyphron. The seven first, ending with the
      Menon, he conceives to have been published successively during the
      lifetime of Sokrates: the Menon itself, during the interval
      between his indictment and <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page311" id="v1page311"></a>311</span>his death;<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_17" href="#Footnotev1_7_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
      the Apologia and Kriton, very shortly after his death; followed,
      at no long interval, by Gorgias and Euthyphron.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_18" href="#Footnotev1_7_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
      The Ion and Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. are placed by Susemihl among the
      earliest of the Platonic compositions, but as not belonging to the
      regular series. He supposes them to have been called forth by some
      special situation, like Apologia and Kriton, if indeed they be
      Platonic at all, of which he does not feel assured.<a

    </div>
    <p>Immediately after Euthyphron, Susemihl places Euthyd&ecirc;mus,
      which he treats as the commencement of a second series of
      dialogues: the first series, or ethical, being now followed by the
      dialectic, in which the principles, process, and certainty of
      cognition are discussed, though in an indirect and preparatory
      way. This second series consists of Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Kratylus,
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Ph&aelig;drus, Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus,
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, Symposion, Ph&aelig;don. Through all these
      dialogues Susemihl professes to trace a thread of connection, each
      successively unfolding and determining more of the general
      subject: but all in an indirect, negative, round-about manner.
      Allowing for this manner, Susemihl contends that the dialectical
      counter-demonstrations or Antinomies, occupying the last half of
      the Parmenid&ecirc;s, include the solution of those difficulties,
      which have come forward in various forms from the Euthyd&ecirc;mus
      up to the Sophist&ecirc;s, against Plato&#8217;s theory of Ideas.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_20" href="#Footnotev1_7_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
      The Ph&aelig;don closes the series of dialectic compositions, and
      opens the way to the constructive dialogues following, partly
      ethical, partly physical &#8212; Phil&ecirc;bus, Republic, Tim&aelig;us,
      Kritias.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_21" href="#Footnotev1_7_21"><span

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_12"

        principle of arrangement, founded upon the different period
        which each dialogue exhibits of the life, philosophical growth,
        and old age, of Sokrates &#8212; his arrangement, founded on this
        principle. He distinguishes the chronological order of
        composition from the place allotted to each dialogue in the
        systematic plan.</span></p>
    <p>A more recent critic, Dr. Edward Munk, has broached a new and
      very different theory as to the natural order of the Platonic
      dialogues. Upon his theory, they were intended by Plato<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_22" href="#Footnotev1_7_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
      to depict the life and working of a philosopher, in successive
      dramatic exhibitions, from youth to old age. The different moments
      in the life of Sokrates, indicated in each dialogue, mark the the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page312" id="v1page312"></a>312</span>place



      which Plato intended it to occupy in the series. The
      Parmenid&ecirc;s is the first, wherein Sokrates is introduced as a
      young man, initiated into philosophy by the ancient
      Parmenid&ecirc;s: the Ph&aelig;don is last, describing as it does
      the closing scene of Sokrates. Plato meant his dialogues to be
      looked at partly in artistic sequence, as a succession of
      historical dramas &#8212; partly in philosophical sequence, as a record
      of the progressive development of his own doctrine: the two
      principles are made to harmonize in the main, though sometimes the
      artistic sequence is obscured for the purpose of bringing out the
      philosophical, sometimes the latter is partially sacrificed to the
      former.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_23" href="#Footnotev1_7_23"><span
          class="sp">23</span></a> Taken in the aggregate, the dialogues
      from Parmenid&ecirc;s to Ph&aelig;don form a Sokratic cycle,
      analogous to the historical plays of Shakespeare, from King John
      to Henry VIII.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_24" href="#Footnotev1_7_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> But Munk at the same time contends
      that this natural order of the dialogues &#8212; or the order in which
      Plato intended them to be viewed &#8212; is not to be confounded with
      the chronological order of their composition.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_25" href="#Footnotev1_7_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a>
      The Parmenid&ecirc;s, though constituting the opening Prologue of
      the whole cycle, was not composed first: nor the Ph&aelig;don
      last. All of them were probably composed after Plato had attained
      the full maturity of his philosophy: that is, probably after the
      opening of his school at the Academy in 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      But in composing each, he had always two objects jointly in view:
      he adapted the tone of each to the age and situation in which he
      wished to depict Sokrates:<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_26"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> he
      commemorated, in each, one of the past phases of his own
      philosophising mind. </p>

    <p>The Cycle taken in its intentional or natural order, is

    <p>The Leges and Menexenus stand apart from the Cycle, as
      compositions on special occasion. Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., Hippias

        purpose for the later dialogues, composed after the foundation
        of the school, but not for the earlier.</span></p>
    <p>Lastly, we have another German author still more recent,
      Frederick Ueberweg, who has again investigated the order and
      authenticity of the Platonic dialogues, in a work of great care
      and ability: reviewing the theories of his predecessors, as well
      as proposing various modifications of his own.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_31" href="#Footnotev1_7_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a>
      Ueberweg compares the different opinions of Schleiermacher and K.
      F. Hermann, and admits both of them to a certain extent, each
      concurrent with and limiting the other.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_32"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> The
      theory of a preconceived system and methodical series, proposed by
      Schleiermacher, takes its departure from the Ph&aelig;drus, and
      postulates as an essential condition that that dialogue shall be
      recognised as the earliest composition.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_33"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> This
      condition Ueberweg does not admit. He agrees with Hermann,
      Stallbaum, and others, in referring the Ph&aelig;drus to a later
      date (about 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), shortly after
      Plato had established his school in Athens, when he was rather
      above forty years of age. At this period (Ueberweg thinks) Plato
      may be considered as having acquired methodical views which had
      not been present to him before; and the dialogues <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page314" id="v1page314"></a>314</span>composed



      after the Ph&aelig;drus follow out, to a certain extent, these
      methodical views. In the Ph&aelig;drus, the Platonic Sokrates
      delivers the opinion that writing is unavailing as a means of
      imparting philosophy: that the only way in which philosophy can be
      imparted is, through oral colloquy adapted by the teacher to the
      mental necessities, and varying stages of progress, of each
      individual learner: and that writing can only serve, after such
      oral instruction has been imparted, to revive it if forgotten, in
      the memory both of the teacher and of the learner who has been
      orally taught. For the dialogues composed after the opening of the
      school, and after the Ph&aelig;drus, Ueberweg recognises the
      influence of a preconceived method and of a constant bearing on
      the oral teaching of the school: for those anterior to that date,
      he admits no such influence: he refers them (with Hermann) to
      successive enlargements, suggestions, inspirations, either arising
      in Plato&#8217;s own mind, or communicated from without. Ueberweg does
      not indeed altogether exclude the influence of this non-methodical
      cause, even for the later dialogues: he allows its operation to a
      certain extent, in conjunction with the methodical: what he
      excludes is, the influence of any methodical or preconceived
      scheme for the earlier dialogues.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_34"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> He thinks
      that Plato composed the later portion of his dialogues (<i>i.e.</i>,
      those subsequent to the Ph&aelig;drus and to the opening of his
      school), not for the instruction of the general reader, but as
      reminders to his disciples of that which they had already learnt
      from oral teaching: and he cites the analogy of Paul and the
      apostles, who wrote epistles not to convert the heathen, but to
      admonish or confirm converts already made by preaching.<a

        durchweg mit einander zu verbinden, so liegt es auch in der

        Ueberweg, pp. 80-86, &#8220;Ist unsere obige Deutung richtig, wonach
        Platon nicht f&uuml;r Fremde zur Belehrung, sondern wesentlich
        f&uuml;r seine Sch&uuml;ler zur Erinnerung an den
        m&uuml;ndlichen Unterricht, schrieb (wie die Apostel nicht
        f&uuml;r Fremde zur Bekehrung, sondern f&uuml;r die christlichen
        Gemeinden zur St&auml;rke und L&auml;uterung, nachdem denselben
        der Glaube aus der Predigt gekommen war) &#8212; so folgt, dass jede
        Argumentation, die auf den Phaedrus gegr&uuml;ndet wird, nur
        f&uuml;r die Zeit gelten kann, in welcher bereits die
        Platonische Schule bestand.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ueberweg investigates the means which we possess, either from <span

      testimony (especially that of Aristotle) or from internal
      evidence, of determining the authenticity as well as the
      chronological order of the dialogues. He remarks that though, in
      contrasting the expository dialogues with those which are simply
      enquiring and debating, we may presume the expository to belong to
      Plato&#8217;s full maturity of life, and to have been preceded by some
      of the enquiring and debating &#8212; yet we cannot safely presume <i>all</i>
      these latter to be of his early composition. Plato may have
      continued to inclined to compose dialogues of mere search, even
      after the time when he began to compose expository dialogues.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_36" href="#Footnotev1_7_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
      Ueberweg considers that the earliest of Plato&#8217;s dialogues are,
      Lysis, Hippias Minor, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, Protagoras,
      composed during the lifetime of Sokrates: next the Apologia, and
      Kriton, not long after his death. All these (even the Protagoras)
      he reckons among the &#8220;lesser Platonic writings&#8221;.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_37" href="#Footnotev1_7_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
      None of them allude to the Platonic Ideas or Objective Concepts.
      The Gorgias comes next, probably soon after the death of Sokrates,
      at least at some time earlier than the opening of the school in
      386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FnAnchorv1_7_38"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> The Menon
      and Ion may be placed about the same general period.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_39" href="#Footnotev1_7_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
      The Ph&aelig;drus (as has been already observed) is considered by
      Ueberweg to be nearly contemporary with the opening of the school:
      shortly afterwards Symposion and Euthyd&ecirc;mus:<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_40" href="#Footnotev1_7_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a>
      at some subsequent time, Republic, Tim&aelig;us, Kritias, and
      Leges. In regard to the four last, Ueberweg does not materially
      differ from Schleiermacher, Hermann, and other critics: but on
      another point he differs from them materially, <i>viz.</i>: that
      instead of placing the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Sophist&ecirc;s, and
      Politikus, in the Megaric period or prior to the opening of the
      school, he assigns them (as well as the Ph&aelig;don and
      Phil&ecirc;bus) to the last twenty years of Plato&#8217;s life. He
      places Ph&aelig;don later than Tim&aelig;us, and Politikus later
      than Ph&aelig;don: he considers that Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus,
      and Phil&ecirc;bus are among the latest compositions of Plato.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_41" href="#Footnotev1_7_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a>
      He rejects Hippias Major, Erast&aelig;, Theag&ecirc;s, Kleitophon,
      and Parmenid&ecirc;s: he is <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page316" id="v1page316"></a>316</span>inclined to
      reject Euthyphron. He scarcely recognises Menexenus, in spite of
      the direct attestation of Aristotle, which attestation he tries
      (in my judgment very unsuccessfully) to invalidate.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_42" href="#Footnotev1_7_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
      He recognises the Kratylus, but without determining its date. He
      determines nothing about Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II. </p>

        dissensions about scheme and order of the dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>The works above enumerated are those chiefly deserving of notice,
      though there are various others also useful, amidst the abundance
      of recent Platonic criticism. All these writers, Schleiermacher,
      Ast, Socher, K. F. Hermann, Stallbaum, Steinhart, Susemihl, Munk,
      Ueberweg, have not merely laid down general schemes of arrangement
      for the Platonic dialogues, but have gone through the dialogues
      seriatim, each endeavouring to show that his own scheme fits them
      well, and each raising objections against the schemes earlier than
      his own. It is indeed truly remarkable to follow the differences
      of opinion among these learned men, all careful students of the
      Platonic writings. And the number of dissents would be
      indefinitely multiplied, if we took into the account the various
      historians of philosophy during the last few years. Ritter and
      Brandis accept, in the main, the theory of Schleiermacher: Zeller
      also, to a certain extent. But each of these authors has had a
      point of view more or less belonging to himself respecting the
      general scheme and purpose of Plato, and respecting the
      authenticity, sequence, and reciprocal illustration of the
      dialogues.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_43" href="#Footnotev1_7_43"><span

        Socher remarks (Ueber, Platon. p. 225) (after enumerating
        twenty-two dialogues of the Thrasyllean canon, which he
        considers the earliest) that of these twenty-two, there are <i>only



          two</i> which have not been declared spurious by some one or
        more critics. He then proceeds to examine the remainder, among
        which are Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, Parmenid&ecirc;s. He
        (Socher) declares these three last to be spurious, which no
        critic had declared before.</p>

        instructive &#8212; but no solution has been obtained.</span></p>
    <p>By such criticisms much light has been thrown on the dialogues in
      detail. It is always interesting to read the different views taken
      by many scholars, all careful students of Plato, respecting the
      order and relations of the dialogues: especially as the views are
      not merely different but contradictory, so that the weak points of
      each are put before us as well as the strong. But as to the large
      problem which these critics have undertaken to solve &#8212; though
      several solutions have been proposed, in favour <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page317" id="v1page317"></a>317</span>of



      which something may be urged, yet we look in vain for any solution
      at once sufficient as to proof and defensible against objectors. </p>

        Extent and novelty of the theory propounded by Schleiermacher &#8212;
        slenderness of his proofs.</span></p>
    <p>It appears to me that the problem itself is one which admits of
      no solution. Schleiermacher was the first who proposed it with the
      large pretensions which it has since embraced, and which have been
      present more or less to the minds of subsequent critics, even when
      they differ from him. He tells us himself that he comes forward as
      <i>Restitutor Platonis</i>, in a character which no one had ever
      undertaken before.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_44"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> And he
      might fairly have claimed that title, if he had furnished proofs
      at all commensurate to his professions. As his theory is
      confessedly novel as well as comprehensive, it required greater
      support in the way of evidence. But when I read the Introductions
      (the general as well as the special) in which such evidence ought
      to be found, I am amazed to find that there is little else but
      easy and confident assumption. His hypothesis is announced as if
      the simple announcement were sufficient to recommend it<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_45" href="#Footnotev1_7_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
      &#8212; as if no other supposition were consistent with the recognised
      grandeur of Plato as a philosopher &#8212; as if any one, dissenting
      from it, only proved thereby that he did not understand Plato. Yet
      so far from being of this self-recommending character, the
      hypothesis is really loaded with the heaviest antecedent
      improbability. That in 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and
      at the age of 23, in an age when schemes of philosophy elaborated
      in detail were unknown &#8212; Plato should conceive a vast scheme of
      philosophy, to be worked out underground without ever being
      proclaimed, through numerous Sokratic dialogues one after the
      other, each ushering in that which follows and each resting upon
      that which precedes: that he should have persisted throughout a
      long life in working out this scheme, adapting the sequence of his
      dialogues to the successive stages which he had attained, so that
      none of them could be properly understood unless when <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page318" id="v1page318"></a>318</span>studied



      immediately after its predecessors and immediately before its
      successors &#8212; and yet that he should have taken no pains to impress
      this one peremptory arrangement on the minds of readers, and that
      Schleiermacher should be the first to detect it &#8212; all this appears
      to me as improbable as any of the mystic interpretations of
      Iamblichus or Proklus. Like other improbabilities, it may be
      proved by evidence, if evidence can be produced: but here nothing
      of the kind is producible. We are called upon to grant the general
      hypothesis without proof, and to follow Schleiermacher in applying
      it to the separate dialogues. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_7_18"></a>Schleiermacher&#8217;s hypothesis includes
        a preconceived scheme, and a peremptory order of interdependence
        among the dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>Schleiermacher&#8217;s hypothesis includes two parts. 1. A premeditated
      philosophical scheme, worked out continuously from the first
      dialogue to the last. 2. A peremptory canonical order, essential
      to this scheme, and determined thereby. Now as to the scheme,
      though on the one hand it cannot be proved, yet on the other hand
      it cannot be disproved. But as to the canonical order, I think it
      may be disproved. We know that no such order was recognised in the
      days of Aristophanes, and Schleiermacher himself admits that
      before those days it had been lost.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_46"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> But I
      contend that if it was lost within a century after the decease of
      Plato, we may fairly presume that it never existed at all, as
      peremptory and indispensable to the understanding of what Plato
      meant. A great philosopher such as Plato (so Schleiermacher
      argues) must be supposed to have composed all his dialogues with
      some preconceived comprehensive scheme: but a great philosopher
      (we may add), if he does work upon a preconceived scheme, must
      surely be supposed to take some reasonable precautions to protect
      the order essential to that scheme from dropping out of sight.
      Moreover, Schleiermacher himself admits that there are various
      dialogues which lie apart from the canonical order and form no
      part of the grand premeditated scheme. The distinction here made
      between these outlying compositions (Nebenwerke) and the members
      of the regular series, is indeed altogether arbitrary: but the
      admission of it tends still farther to invalidate the fundamental
      postulate of a grand Demiurgic universe of dialogues,<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page319" id="v1page319"></a>319</span>
      each dovetailed and fitted into its special place among the whole.
      The universe is admitted to have breaks: so that the hypothesis
      does not possess the only merit which can belong to gratuitous
      hypothesis &#8212; that of introducing, if granted, complete symmetry
      throughout the phenomena.</p>

    <p>To these various improbabilities we may add another &#8212; that
      Schleiermacher&#8217;s hypothesis requires us to admit that the
      Ph&aelig;drus is Plato&#8217;s earliest dialogue, composed about 406 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when he was 21 years of age, on my
      computation, and certainly not more than 23: that it is the first
      outburst of the inspiration which Sokrates had imparted to him,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_47" href="#Footnotev1_7_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
      and that it embodies, though in a dim and poetical form, the
      lineaments of that philosophical system which he worked out during
      the ensuing half century. That Plato at this early age should have
      conceived so vast a system &#8212; that he should have imbibed it from
      Sokrates, who enunciated no system, and abounded in the
      anti-systematic negative &#8212; that he should have been inspired to
      write the Ph&aelig;drus (with its abundant veins, dithyrambic,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_48" href="#Footnotev1_7_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
      erotic, and transcendental) by the conversation of Sokrates, which
      exhibited acute dialectic combined with practical sagacity, but
      neither poetic fervour nor transcendental fancy, &#8212; in all this
      hypothesis of Schleiermacher, there is nothing but an aggravation
      of improbabilities. </p>

        If we read Dionysius of Halikarnassus (De Admirab. Vi Dic. in
        Demosth. pp. 968-971, Reiske), we shall find that rhetor
        pointing out the Ph&aelig;drus as a signal example of Plato&#8217;s
        departure from the manner and character of Sokrates, and as a
        specimen of misplaced poetical exaggeration. Dik&aelig;archus
        formed the same opinion about the Ph&aelig;drus (Diog. L. iii.
        38).</p>

        critic, has as yet produced any tolerable proof for an internal
        theory of the Platonic dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>Against such improbabilities (partly external partly internal)
      Schleiermacher has nothing to set except internal reasons: that
      is, when he shall have arranged the dialogues and explained the
      interdependence as well as the special place of each, the
      arrangement will impress itself upon all as being the intentional
      work of Plato himself.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_49"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> But these
      &#8220;internal reasons&#8221; (innere Gr&uuml;nde), which are to serve as
      constructive evidence (in the absence of positive declarations) of
      Plato&#8217;s purpose, fail to produce upon other minds the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page320" id="v1page320"></a>320</span>effect



      which Schleiermacher demands. If we follow them as stated in his
      Introductions (prefixed to the successive Platonic dialogues), we
      find a number of approximations and comparisons, often just and
      ingenious, but always inconclusive for his point: proving, at the
      very best, what Plato&#8217;s intention may possibly have been &#8212; yet
      subject to be countervailed by other &#8220;internal reasons&#8221; equally
      specious, tending to different conclusions. And the various
      opponents of Schleiermacher prove just as much and no more, each
      on behalf of his own mode of arrangement, by the like constructive
      evidence &#8212; appeal to &#8220;internal reasons&#8221;. But the insufficient
      character of these &#8220;internal reasons&#8221; is more fatal to
      Schleiermacher than to any of his opponents: because his
      fundamental hypothesis &#8212; while it is the most ambitious of all and
      would be the most important, if it could be proved &#8212; is at the
      same time burdened with the strongest antecedent improbability,
      and requires the amplest proof to make it at all admissible. </p>

        and the most gratuitous, next to Schleiermacher&#8217;s.</span></p>
    <p>Dr. Munk undertakes the same large problem as Schleiermacher. He
      assumes the Platonic dialogues to have been composed upon a
      preconceived system, beginning when Plato opened his school, about
      41 years of age. This has somewhat less antecedent improbability
      than the supposition that Plato conceived his system at 21 or 23
      years of age. But it is just as much destitute of positive
      support. That Plato intended his dialogues to form a fixed series,
      exhibiting the successive gradations of his philosophical system &#8212;
      that he farther intended this series to coincide with a string of
      artistic portraits, representing Sokrates in the ascending march
      from youth to old age, so that the characteristic feature which
      marks the place and time of each dialogue, is to be found in the
      age which it assigns to Sokrates &#8212; these are positions for the
      proof of which we are referred to &#8220;internal reasons&#8221;; but which
      the dialogues do not even suggest, much less sanction. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_22"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_22"></a>The age assigned to Sokrates in any
        dialogue is a circumstance of little moment.</span></p>
    <p>In many dialogues, the age assigned to Sokrates is a circumstance
      neither distinctly brought out, nor telling on the debate. It is
      true that in the Parmenid&ecirc;s he is noted as young, and is
      made to conduct himself with the deference of youth, receiving
      hints and admonitions <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page321"
          id="v1page321"></a>321</span>from the respected veteran of
      Elea. So too in the Protagoras, he is characterised as young, but
      chiefly in contrast with the extreme and pronounced old age of the
      Sophist Protagoras: he does not conduct himself like a youth, nor
      exhibit any of that really youthful or deferential spirit which we
      find in the Parmenid&ecirc;s; on the contrary, he stands forward
      as the rival, cross-examiner, and conqueror of the ancient
      Sophist. On the contrary, in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_50" href="#Footnotev1_7_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
      Sokrates is announced as old; though that dialogue is indisputably
      very analogous to the Protagoras, both of them being placed by
      Munk in the earliest of his three groups. Moreover in the Lysis
      also, Sokrates appears as old; &#8212; here Munk escapes from the
      difficulty by setting aside the dialogue as a youthful
      composition, not included in the consecutive Sokratic Cycle.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_51" href="#Footnotev1_7_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
      What is there to justify the belief, that the Sokrates depicted in
      the Ph&aelig;drus (which dialogue has been affirmed by
      Schieiermacher and Ast, besides some ancient critics, to exhibit
      decided marks of juvenility) is older than the Sokrates of the
      Symposion? or that Sokrates in the Phil&ecirc;bus and Republic is
      older than in the Kratylus or Gorgias? It is true that the
      dialogues The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and Euthyphron are both
      represented as held a little before the death of Sokrates, after
      the indictment of Mel&ecirc;tus against him had already been
      preferred. This is a part of the hypothetical situation, in which
      the dialogists are brought into company. But there is nothing in
      the two dialogues themselves (or in the Menon, which Munk places
      in the same category) to betoken that Sokrates is old. Holiness,
      in the Euthyphron &#8212; Knowledge, in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; is
      canvassed and debated just as Temperance and Courage are debated
      in the Charmid&ecirc;s and Lach&ecirc;s. Munk lays it down that
      Sokrates appears as a Martyr for Truth in the Euthyphron, Menon,
      and The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and as a Combatant for Truth in the
      Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, Euthyd&ecirc;mus, &amp;c. But the
      two groups of dialogues, when compared with each other, will not
      be found to warrant this distinctive appellation. In the Apologia,
      Kriton, and Ph&aelig;don, it may be said with propriety that
      Sokrates is represented as a martyr for truth: in all three he
      appears not <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page322"
          id="v1page322"></a>322</span>merely as a talker, but as a
      personal agent: but this is not true of the other dialogues which
      Munk places in his third group. </p>

    <p>I cannot therefore accede to this &#8220;natural arrangement of the
      Platonic dialogues,&#8221; assumed to have been intended by Plato, and
      founded upon the progress of Sokrates as he stands exhibited in
      each, from youth to age &#8212; which Munk has proposed in his recent
      ingenious volume. It is interesting to be made acquainted with
      that order of the Platonic dialogues which any critical student
      conceives to be the &#8220;natural order&#8221;. But in respect to Munk as
      well as to Schleiermacher, I must remark that if Plato had
      conceived and predetermined the dialogues, so as to be read in one
      natural peremptory order, he would never have left that order so
      dubious and imperceptible, as to be first divined by critics of
      the nineteenth century, and understood by them too in several
      different ways. If there were any peremptory and intentional
      sequence, we may reasonably presume that Plato would have made it
      as clearly understood as he has determined the sequence of the ten
      books of his Republic. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_24"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_24"></a>Principle of arrangement adopted by
        Hermann is reasonable &#8212; successive changes in Plato&#8217;s point of
        view: but we cannot explain either the order or the causes of
        these changes.</span></p>
    <p>The principle of arrangement proposed by K. F. Hermann (approved
      also by Steinhart and Susemihl) is not open to the same antecedent
      objection. Not admitting any preconceived, methodical,
      intentional, system, nor the maintenance of one and the same
      successive philosophical point of view throughout &#8212; Hermann
      supposes that the dialogues as successively composed represent
      successive phases of Plato&#8217;s philosophical development and
      variations in his point of view. Hermann farther considers that
      these variations may be assigned and accounted for: first pure
      Sokratism, next the modifications experienced from Plato&#8217;s
      intercourse with the Megaric philosophers, &#8212; then the influence
      derived from Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Egypt &#8212; subsequently that from
      the Pythagoreans in Italy &#8212; and so forth. The first portion of
      this hypothesis, taken generally, is very reasonable and probable.
      But when, after assuming that there must have been determining
      changes in Plato&#8217;s own mind, we proceed to inquire what these
      were, and whence they arose, we find a sad lack of evidence for
      the answer to the question. We <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page323" id="v1page323"></a>323</span>neither know the
      order in which the dialogues were composed, &#8212; nor the date when
      Plato first began to compose, &#8212; nor the primitive philosophical
      mind which his earliest dialogues represented, &#8212; nor the order of
      those subsequent modifications which his views underwent. We are
      informed, indeed, that Plato went from Athens to visit Megara,
      Kyr&ecirc;n&ecirc;, Egypt, Italy; but the extent or kind of
      influence which he experienced in each, we do not know at all.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_52" href="#Footnotev1_7_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
      I think it a reasonable presumption that the points which Plato
      had in common with Sokrates were most preponderant in the mind of
      Plato immediately after the death of his master: and that other
      trains of thought gradually became more and more intermingled as
      the recollection of his master became more distant. There is also
      a presumption that the longer, more elaborate, and more
      transcendental dialogues (among which must be ranked the
      Ph&aelig;drus), were composed in the full maturity of Plato&#8217;s age
      and intellect: the shorter and less finished may have been
      composed either then or earlier in his life. Here are two
      presumptions, plausible enough when stated generally, yet too
      vague to justify any special inferences: the rather, if we may
      believe the statement of Dionysius, that Plato continued to &#8220;comb
      and curl his dialogues until he was eighty years of age&#8221;.<a

        Bonitz (in his instructive volume, Platonische Studien, Wien,
        1858, p. 5) points out how little we know about the real
        circumstances of Plato&#8217;s intellectual and philosophical
        development: a matter which most of the Platonic critics are apt
        to forget. </p>
      <p>I confess that I agree with Str&uuml;mpell, that it is
        impossible to determine chronologically, from Plato&#8217;s writings,
        and from the other scanty evidence accessible to us, by what
        successive steps his mind departed from the original views and
        doctrines held and communicated by Sokrates (Str&uuml;mpell,
        Gesch. der Griechen, p. 294, Leipsic, 1861).</p>

      <p>Preller has a like remark (Hist. Phil. ex Font. Loc. Context.,
        sect. 250). </p>
      <p>In regard to the habit of correcting compositions, the contrast
        between Plato and Plotinus was remarkable. Porphyry tells us
        that Plotinus, when once he had written any matter, could hardly
        bear even to read it over &#8212; much less to review and improve it
        (Porph. Vit. Plotini, 8).</p>

        Schleiermacher&#8217;s.</span></p>
    <p>If we compare K. F. Hermann with Schleiermacher, we see <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page324" id="v1page324"></a>324</span>that



      Hermann has amended his position by abandoning Schleiermacher&#8217;s
      gratuitous hypothesis, of a preconceived Platonic system with a
      canonical order of the dialogues adapted to that system &#8212; and by
      admitting only a chronological order of composition, each dialogue
      being generated by the state of Plato&#8217;s mind at the time when it
      was composed. This, taken generally, is indisputable. If we
      perfectly knew Plato&#8217;s biography and the circumstances around him,
      we should be able to determine which dialogues were first, second,
      and third, &amp;c., and what circumstances or mental dispositions
      occasioned the successive composition of those which followed. But
      can we do this with our present scanty information? I think not.
      Hermann, while abandoning the hypothesis of Schleiermacher, has
      still accepted the large conditions of the problem first drawn up
      by Schleiermacher, and has undertaken to decide the real order of
      the dialogues, together with the special occasion and the phase of
      Platonic development corresponding to each. Herein, I think, he
      has failed. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_26"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_26"></a>Small number of certainties, or even
        reasonable presumptions, as to date or order of the dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>It is, indeed, natural that critics should form some impression
      as to earlier and later in the dialogues. But though there are
      some peculiar cases in which such impression acquires much force,
      I conceive that in almost all cases it is to a high degree
      uncertain. Several dialogues proclaim themselves as subsequent to
      the death of Sokrates. We know from internal allusions that the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus must have been composed after 394 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the Menexenus after 387 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and the Symposion after 385 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> We are sure, by Aristotle&#8217;s testimony,
      that the Leges were written at a later period than the Republic;
      Plutarch also states that the Leges were composed during the old
      age of Plato, and this statement, accepted by most modern critics,
      appears to me trustworthy.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_54"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> The
      Sophist&ecirc;s proclaims itself as a second meeting, by mutual
      agreement, of the same persons who had conversed in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, with the addition of a new companion, the
      Eleatic stranger. But we must remark that the subject of the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, though left unsettled at the close of that
      dialogue, is not resumed in the Sophist&ecirc;s: in which last, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page325" id="v1page325"></a>325</span>moreover,



      Sokrates acts only a subordinate part, while the Eleatic stranger,
      who did not appear in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, is here put
      forward as the prominent questioner or expositor. So too, the
      Politikus offers itself as a third of the same triplet: with this
      difference, that while the Eleatic stranger continues as the
      questioner, a new respondent appears in the person of Sokrates
      Junior. The Politikus is not a resumption of the same subject as
      the Sophist&ecirc;s, but a second application of the same method
      (the method of logical division and subdivision) to a different
      subject. Plato speaks also as if he contemplated a third
      application of the same method &#8212; the Philosophus: which, so far as
      we know, was never realised. Again, the Tim&aelig;us presents
      itself as a sequel to the Republic, and the Kritias as a sequel to
      the Tim&aelig;us: a fourth, the Hermokrates, being apparently
      announced, as about to follow &#8212; but not having been composed. </p>

    <p>Here then are two groups of three each (we might call them
      Trilogies, and if the intended fourth had been realised,
      Tetralogies), indicated by Plato himself. A certain relative
      chronological order is here doubtless evident: the Sophist&ecirc;s
      must have been composed after the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and before
      the Politikus, the Tim&aelig;us after the Republic and before the
      Kritias. But this is all that we can infer: for it does not follow
      that the sequence must have been immediate in point of time: there
      may have been a considerable interval between the three forming
      the so-called Trilogy.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_55"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> We may
      add, that neither in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus nor in the
      Republic, do we find indication that either of them is intended as
      the first of a Trilogy: the marks <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page326" id="v1page326"></a>326</span>proving an
      intended Trilogy are only found in the second and third of the
      series. </p>

        It may seem singular that Schleiermacher is among those who
        adopt this opinion. He maintains that the Sophistes does not
        follow <i>immediately</i> upon the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus; that
        Plato, though intending when he finished the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus to proceed onward to the Sophist&ecirc;s,
        altered his intention, and took up other views instead: that the
        Menon (and the Euthyd&ecirc;mus) come in between them, in
        immediate sequel to the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (Einleitung zum
        Menon, vol. iii. p. 326).</p>
      <p>Here Schleiermacher introduces a new element of uncertainty,
        which invalidates yet more seriously the grounds for his
        hypothesis of a preconceived sequence throughout all the
        dialogues. In a case where Plato directly intimates an
        intentional sequence, we are called upon to believe, on
        &#8220;internal grounds&#8221; alone, that he altered his intention, and
        introduced other dialogues. He may have done this: but how are
        we to prove it? How much does it attenuate the value of his
        intentions, as proofs of an internal philosophical sequence? We
        become involved more and more in unsupported hypothesis. I think
        that K. F. Hermann&#8217;s objections against Schleiermacher, on the
        above ground, have much force; and that Ueberweg&#8217;s reply to them
        is unsatisfactory. (Hermann, Gesch. und Syst. der Platon. Phil.
        p. 350. Ueberweg, Untersuchungen, p. 82, seq.)</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_7_28"></a>Positive dates of all the dialogues &#8212;
        unknown.</span></p>
    <p>While even the relative chronology of the dialogues is thus
      faintly marked in the case of a few, and left to fallible
      conjecture in the remainder &#8212; the positive chronology, or the
      exact year of composition, is not directly marked in the case of
      any one. Moreover, at the very outset of the enquiry, we have to
      ask, At what period of life did Plato begin to publish his
      dialogues? Did he publish any of them during the lifetime of
      Sokrates? and if so, which? Or does the earliest of them date from
      a time after the death of Sokrates? </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_29"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_29"></a>When did Plato begin to compose? Not
        till after the death of Sokrates.</span></p>
    <p>Amidst the many dissentient views of the Platonic critics, it is
      remarkable that they are nearly unanimous in their mode of
      answering this question.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_56"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> Most of
      them declare without hesitation, that Plato published several
      before the death of Sokrates &#8212; that is, before he was 28 years of
      age &#8212; though they do not all agree in determining which these
      dialogues were. I do not perceive that they produce any external
      proofs of the least value. Most of them disbelieve (though
      Stallbaum and Hermann believe) the anecdote about Sokrates and his
      criticism on the dialogue Lysis.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_57"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> In spite
      of their unanimity, I cannot but adopt the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page327" id="v1page327"></a>327</span>opposite
      conclusion. It appears to me that Plato composed no Sokratic
      dialogues during the lifetime of Sokrates. </p>

        Valentine Rose (De Aristotelis Librorum ordine, p. 25, Berlin,
        1854), Mullach (Democriti Fragm. p. 99), and R. Sch&ouml;ne (in
        his Commentary on the Platonic Protagoras), are among the
        critics known to me, who intimate their belief that Plato
        published no Sokratic dialogues during the lifetime of Sokrates.
        In discussing the matter, Sch&ouml;ne adverts to two of the
        three lines of argument brought forward in my text:&#8212;1. The too
        early and too copious &#8220;productivity&#8221; which the received
        supposition would imply in Plato. 2. The improbability that the
        name of Sokrates would be employed in written dialogues, as
        spokesman, by any of his scholars during his lifetime. </p>
      <p>Sch&ouml;ne does not touch upon the improbability of the
        hypothesis, arising out of the early position and aspirations of
        Plato himself (Sch&ouml;ne, Ueber Platon&#8217;s Protagoras, p. 64,

        Schleiermacher (Einl. zum Lysis, i. p. 175) treats the anecdote
        about the Lysis as unworthy of credence. Diogenes (iii. 38)
        mentions that some considered the Ph&aelig;drus as Plato&#8217;s
        earliest dialogue; the reason being that the subject of it was
        something puerile: &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#961;&#940;&#968;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957;

        &#966;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;. Olympiodorus also in his life of Plato mentions the
        same report, that the Ph&aelig;drus was Plato&#8217;s earliest
        composition, and gives the same ground of belief, &#8220;its
        dithyrambic character&#8221;. Even if the assertion were granted, that
        the Ph&aelig;drus is the earliest Platonic composition, we could
        not infer that it was composed during the life-time of Sokrates.
        But that assertion cannot be granted. The two statements, above
        cited, give it only as a report, suggested to those who believed
        it by the character and subject-matter of the dialogue. I am
        surprised that Dr. Volquardsen, who in a learned volume,
        recently published, has undertaken the defence of the theory of
        Schleiermacher about the Ph&aelig;drus (Ph&auml;dros, Erste
        Schrift Platon&#8217;s, Kiel, 1862), can represent this as a &#8220;<i>feste
          historische Ueberlieferung</i>&#8221; &#8212; the rather as he admits that
        Schleiermacher himself placed no confidence in it, and relied
        upon other reasons (pp. 90-92-93). Comp. Schleiermacher, Einl.
        zum Phaidros, p. 76.</p>
      <p>Whoever will read the Epistle of Dionysius of Halikarnassus,
        addressed to Cneius Pompeius (pp. 751-765, Reiske), will be
        persuaded that Dionysius can neither have known, nor even
        believed, that the Ph&aelig;drus was the first composition, and
        a youthful composition, of Plato. If Dionysius had believed
        this, it would have furnished him with the precise excuse which
        his letter required. For the purpose of his letter is to mollify
        the displeasure of Cn. Pompey, who had written to blame him for
        some unfavourable criticisms on the style of Plato. Dionysius
        justifies his criticisms by allusions to the Ph&aelig;drus. If
        he had been able to add, that the Ph&aelig;drus was a first
        composition, and that Plato&#8217;s later dialogues were comparatively
        free from the like faults &#8212; this would have been the most
        effective way of conciliating Cn. Pompey.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_30"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_30"></a>Reasons for this opinion. Labour of
        the composition &#8212; does not consist with youth of the author.</span></p>
    <p>All the information (scanty as it is) which we obtain from the
      rhetor Dionysius and others respecting the composition of the
      Platonic dialogues, announces them to have cost much time and
      labour to their author: a statement illustrated by the great
      number of inversions of words which he is said to have introduced
      successively in the first sentence of the Republic, before he was
      satisfied to let the sentence stand. This corresponds, too, with
      all that we read respecting the patient assiduity both of
      Isokrates and Demosthenes.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_58"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> A
      first-rate Greek composition was understood not to be purchasable
      at lower cost. I confess therefore to great surprise, when I read
      in Ast the affirmation that the Protagoras was composed when Plato
      was only 22 years old &#8212; and when I find Schleiermacher asserting,
      as if it were a matter beyond dispute, that Protagoras,
      Ph&aelig;drus, and Parmenid&ecirc;s, all bear evident marks of
      Plato&#8217;s youthful age (Jugendlichkeit). In regard to the
      Ph&aelig;drus and Parmenid&ecirc;s, indeed, Hermann and other
      critics contest the view of Schleiermacher; and detect, in those
      two dialogues, not only no marks of &#8220;juvenility,&#8221; but what they
      consider plain proofs of maturity and even of late age. But in
      regard to the Protagoras, most of them agree with Schleiermacher
      and Ast, in declaring it to be a work of Plato&#8217;s youth, some time
      before the death of Sokrates. <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page328" id="v1page328"></a>328</span>Now on this
      point I dissent from them: and since the decision turns upon
      &#8220;internal grounds,&#8221; each must judge for himself. The Protagoras
      appears to me one of the most finished and elaborate of all the
      dialogues: in complication of scenic arrangements, dramatic
      vivacity, and in the amount of theory worked out, it is surpassed
      by none &#8212; hardly even by the Republic.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_59"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> Its
      merits as a composition are indeed extolled by all the critics;
      who clap their hands, especially, at the humiliation which they
      believe to be brought upon the great Sophist by Sokrates. But the
      more striking the composition is acknowledged to be, the stronger
      is the presumption that its author was more than 22 or 24 years of
      age. Nothing short of good positive testimony would induce me to
      believe that such a dialogue as the Protagoras could have been
      composed, even by Plato, before he attained the plenitude of his
      powers. No such testimony is produced or producible. I extend a
      similar presumption, even to the Lysis, Lach&ecirc;s,
      Charmid&ecirc;s, and other dialogues: though with a less degree of
      confidence, because they are shorter and less artistic, not equal
      to the Protagoras. All of them, in my judgment, exhibit a richness
      of ideas and a variety of expression, which suggest something very
      different from a young novice as the author. </p>

    <p>But over and above this presumption, there are other reasons
      which induce me to believe, that none of the Platonic dialogues
      were published during the lifetime of Sokrates. My reasons are
      partly connected with Sokrates, partly with Plato. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_31"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_31"></a>Reasons founded on the personality of
        Sokrates, and his relations with Plato.</span></p>
    <p>First, in reference to Sokrates &#8212; we may reasonably doubt whether
      any written reports of his actual conversations were published
      during his lifetime. He was the most constant, public, and
      indiscriminate of all talkers: always in some frequented place,
      and desiring nothing so much as a respondent with an audience.
      Every one who chose to hear him, might do so without payment and
      with the utmost facility. Why then should any one wish to read
      written reports of his conversations? especially when we know that
      the strong interest which they excited in the hearers depended
      much upon the spontaneity of his <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page329" id="v1page329"></a>329</span> inspirations,
      and hardly less upon the singularity of his manner and
      physiognomy. Any written report of what he said must appear
      comparatively tame. Again, as to fictitious dialogues (like the
      Platonic) employing the name of Sokrates as spokesman &#8212; such might
      doubtless be published during his lifetime by derisory dramatists
      for the purpose of raising a laugh, but not surely by a respectful
      disciple and admirer for the purpose of giving utterance to
      doctrines of his own. The greater was the respect felt by Plato
      for Sokrates, the less would he be likely to take the liberty of
      making Sokrates responsible before the public for what Sokrates
      had never said.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_60" href="#Footnotev1_7_60"><span
          class="sp">60</span></a> There is a story in Diogenes &#8212; to the
      effect that Sokrates, when he first heard the Platonic dialogue
      called Lysis, exclaimed &#8212; &#8220;What a heap of falsehoods does the
      young man utter about me!&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_61"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> This
      story merits no credence as a fact: but it expresses the
      displeasure which Sokrates would be likely to feel, on hearing
      that one of his youthful companions had dramatised him as he
      appears in the Lysis. Xenophon tells us, and it is very probable,
      that inaccurate oral reports of the real colloquies of Sokrates
      may have got into circulation. But that the friends and disciples
      of Sokrates, during his lifetime, should deliberately publish
      fictitious dialogues, putting their own sentiments into his mouth,
      and thus contribute to mislead the public &#8212; is not easily
      credible. Still less credible is it that Plato, during the
      lifetime of Sokrates, should have published such a dialogue as the
      Ph&aelig;drus, wherein we find ascribed to Sokrates, poetical and
      dithyrambic effusions utterly at variance with the real
      manifestations which Athenians might hear every day from Sokrates
      in the market-place.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_62"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> Sokrates
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page330" id="v1page330"></a>330</span>in



      the Platonic Apology, complains of the comic poet Aristophanes for
      misrepresenting him. Had the Platonic Ph&aelig;drus been then in
      circulation, or any other Platonic dialogues, he might with
      equally good reason have warned the Dikasts against judging of
      him, a real citizen on trial, from the titular Sokrates whom even
      disciples did not scruple to employ as spokesman for their own
      transcendental doctrine, and their own controversial sarcasms. </p>

        Valentine Rose observes, in regard to a dialogue composed by
        some one else, wherein Plato was introduced as one of the
        interlocutors, that it could not have been composed until after
        Plato&#8217;s death, and that the dialogues of Plato were not composed
        until after the death of Sokrates. &#8220;Platonis autem sermones
        antequam mortuus fuerit, scripto neminem tradidisse, neque
        magistri viventis person&acirc; in dialogis abusos fuisse (non
        magis quam vivum Socratem induxerunt Xenophon, Plato,
        c&aelig;teri Socratici), hoc veterum mori et religioni quivis
        facile concedet,&#8221; &amp;c. (V. Rose, Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus,
        pp. 57, 74, Leipsic, 1863.) &#8212; Val. Rose expresses the same
        opinion (that none of the Sokratic dialogues, either by Plato or
        the other companions of Sokrates, were written until after the
        death of Sokrates) in his earlier work, De Aristotelis Librorum
        Ordine et Auctoritate, p. 25.</p>

        In regard to the theory (elaborated by Schleiermacher, recently
        again defended by Volquardsen), that the Ph&aelig;drus is the
        earliest among the Platonic dialogues, composed about 406 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>, it appears to me inconsistent also
        with what we know about Lysias. In the Platonic Ph&aelig;drus,
        Lysias is presented as a &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962; of the highest reputation
        and eminence (p. 228 A, 257 C, and indeed throughout the whole
        dialogue). Now this is quite inconsistent with what we read from
        Lysias himself in the indictment which he preferred against
        Eratosthenes, not long after the restoration of the democracy,
        403 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> He protests therein
        strenuously that he had never had judicial affairs of his own,
        nor meddled with those of others; and he expresses the greatest
        apprehension from his own &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#943;&#945; (sects. 4-6). I cannot believe
        that this would be said by a person whom Ph&aelig;drus terms
        &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8035;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;. Moreover, Lysias, in that same
        discourse, describes his own position at Athens, anterior to the
        Thirty: he belonged to a rich metic family, and was engaged
        along with his brother Polemarchus in a large manufactory of
        shields, employing 120 slaves (s. 20). A person thus rich and
        occupied was not likely to become a professed and notorious
        &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962;, though he may have been a clever and accomplished
        man. Lysias was plundered and impoverished by the Thirty; and he
        is said to have incurred much expense in aiding the efforts of
        Thrasybulus. It was after this change of circumstances that he
        took to rhetoric as a profession; and it is to some one of these
        later years that the Platonic Ph&aelig;drus refers.</p>
    </div>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_32"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_32"></a>Reasons, founded on the early life,
        character, and position of Plato.</span></p>
    <p>Secondly, in regard to Plato, the reasons leading to the same
      conclusion are yet stronger. Unfortunately, we know little of the
      life of Plato before he attained the age of 28, that is, before
      the death of Sokrates: but our best means of appreciating it are
      derived from three sources. 1. Our knowledge of the history of
      Athens from 409-399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, communicated
      by Thucydides, Xenophon, &amp;c. 2. The seventh Epistle of Plato
      himself, written four or five years before his death (about 352 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>). 3. A few hints from the Memorabilia
      of Xenophon. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_33"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_33"></a>Plato&#8217;s early life &#8212; active by
        necessity, and to some extent ambitious.</span></p>
    <p>To these evidences about the life of Plato, it has not been
      customary to pay much attention. The Platonic critics seem to
      regard Plato so entirely as a spiritual person (&#8220;like a blessed
      spirit, visiting earth for a short time,&#8221; to cite a poetical
      phrase applied to him by G&ouml;the), that they disdain to take
      account of his relations with the material world, or with society
      around him. Because his mature life was consecrated to philosophy,
      they presume that his youth must have been so likewise. But this
      is a hasty assumption. You cannot thus abstract <i>any</i> man
      from <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page331" id="v1page331"></a>331</span>the



      social medium by which, he is surrounded. The historical
      circumstances of Athens from Plato&#8217;s nineteenth year to his
      twenty-sixth (409-403 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) were
      something totally different from what they afterwards became. They
      were so grave and absorbing, that had he been ever so much
      inclined to philosophy, he would have been compelled against his
      will to undertake active and heavy duty as a citizen. Within those
      years (as I have observed in a preceding <a href="#Sidenotev1_5_4">chapter</a>)
      fell the closing struggles of the Peloponnesian war; in which (to
      repeat words already cited from Thucydides) Athens became more a
      military post than a city &#8212; every citizen being almost habitually
      under arms: then the long blockade, starvation, and capture of the
      city, followed by the violences of the Thirty, the armed struggle
      under Thrasybulus, and the perilous, though fortunately successful
      and equitable, renovation of the democracy. These were not times
      for a young citizen, of good family and robust frame, to devote
      himself exclusively to philosophy and composition. I confess
      myself surprised at the assertion of Schleiermacher and Steinhart,
      that Plato composed the Charmid&ecirc;s and other dialogues under
      the Anarchy.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_63" href="#Footnotev1_7_63"><span
          class="sp">63</span></a> Amidst such disquietude and perils he
      could not have renounced active duty for philosophy, even if he
      had been disposed to do so. </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev1_7_63"

        Steinhart, Einl. zum Laches, vol. i. p. 358, where he says that
        Plato composed the Charmid&ecirc;s, Lach&ecirc;s, and
        Protagoras, all in 404 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> under
        the Thirty. Schleiermacher, Einleitung zum Charmides, vol. ii.
        p. 8.</p>
      <p>The lines of Lucretius (i. 41) bear emphatically upon this
        trying season: </p>
      <table class="reg" summary="poem">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <div class="poem">Nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore
                iniquo <br>
                Possumus &aelig;quo animo nec Memmi clara propago <br>
                Talibus in rebus communi desse saluti. </div>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>But, to make the case stronger, we learn from Plato&#8217;s own
      testimony, in his seventh Epistle, that he was not at that time
      disposed to renounce active political life. He tells us himself,
      that as a young man he was exceedingly eager, like others of the
      same age, to meddle and distinguish himself in active politics.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_64" href="#Footnotev1_7_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
      How natural such eagerness was, to a young citizen of his family
      and condition, may be seen by the analogy of his younger brother
      Glaukon, who was prematurely impatient to come forward: as <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page332" id="v1page332"></a>332</span>well



      as by that of his cousin Charmides, who had the same inclination,
      but was restrained by exaggerated diffidence of character. Now we
      know that the real Sokrates (very different from the Platonic
      Sokrates in the Gorgias) did not seek to deter young men of rank
      from politics, and to consign them to inactive speculation.
      Sokrates gives<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_65" href="#Footnotev1_7_65"><span
          class="sp">65</span></a> earnest encouragement to Charmides;
      and he does not discourage Glaukon, but only presses him to
      adjourn his pretensions until the suitable stock of preliminary
      information has been acquired. We may thus see that assuming the
      young Plato to be animated with political aspirations, he would
      certainly not be dissuaded, &#8212; nay, he would probably be encouraged
      &#8212; by Sokrates. </p>

        See the two interesting colloquies of Sokrates, with Glaukon and
        Charmides (Xenoph. Mem. iii. 6, 7).</p>
      <p>Charmides was killed along with Kritias during the eight months
        called The Anarchy, at the battle fought with Thrasybulus and
        the democrats (Xen. Hell. ii. 4, 19). The colloquy of Sokrates
        with Charmides, recorded by Xenophon in the Memorabilia, must
        have taken place at some time before the battle of
        &AElig;gospotami; perhaps about 407 or 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p>Plato farther tells us that when (after the final capitulation of
      Athens) the democracy was put down and the government of the
      Thirty established, he embarked in it actively under the auspices
      of his relatives (Kritias, Charmides, &amp;c., then in the
      ascendant), with the ardent hopes of youth<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_66" href="#Footnotev1_7_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
      that he should witness and promote the accomplishment of valuable
      reforms. Experience showed him that he was mistaken. He became
      disgusted with the enormities of the Thirty, especially with their
      treatment of Sokrates; and he then ceased to co-operate with them.
      Again, after the year called the Anarchy, the democracy was
      restored, and Plato&#8217;s political aspirations revived along with it.
      He again put himself forward for active public life, though with
      less ardent hopes.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_67"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> But he
      became dissatisfied with the march of affairs, and his
      relationship with the deceased Kritias was now a formidable
      obstacle to popularity. At length, four years after the
      restoration of the democracy, came the trial and condemnation of
      Sokrates. It was that event which finally shocked and disgusted
      Plato, converting his previous dissatisfaction into an utter
      despair of obtaining any good results from existing governments.<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page333" id="v1page333"></a>333</span>
      From thenceforward, he turned away from practice and threw himself

      <p>I have already stated in the 84th chapter of my History,
        describing the visit of Plato to Dionysius in Sicily, that I
        believe the Epistles of Plato to be genuine, and that the
        seventh Epistle especially contains valuable information. Some
        critics undoubtedly are of a different opinion, and consider
        them as spurious. But even among these critics, several consider
        that the author of the Epistles, though not Plato himself, was a
        contemporary and well informed: so that his evidence is
        trustworthy. See K. F. Hermann, Gesammelte Abhandlungen, pp.
        282-283. The question has been again discussed recently by
        Ueberweg (Untersuch. &uuml;ber d. Aechth. u. Zeitf. d. Plat.
        Schriften, pp. 120-123-125-129), who gives his own opinion that
        the letters are not by Plato, and produces various arguments to
        the point. His arguments are noway convincing to me: for the
        mysticism and pedantry of the Epistles appear to me in full
        harmony with the Tim&aelig;us and Leges, and with the
        Pythagorean bias of Plato&#8217;s later years, though not in harmony
        with the Protagoras, and various other dialogues. Yet Ueberweg
        also declares his full belief that the seventh Epistle is the
        composition of a well-informed contemporary, and perfectly
        worthy of credit as to the facts and K. F. Hermann declares the
        same. This is enough for my present purpose. </p>
      <p>The statement, trusted by all the critics, that Plato&#8217;s first
        visit to Syracuse was made when he was about 40 years of age,
        depends altogether on the assertion of the seventh Epistle. How
        numerous are the assertions made by Platonic critics respecting
        Plato, upon evidence far slighter than that of these Epistles!
        Boeckh considers the seventh Epistle as the genuine work of
        Plato. Valentine Rose also pronounces it to be genuine, though
        he does not consider the other Epistles to be so (De Aristotelis
        Librorum Ordine, p. 25, p. 114, Berlin, 1854). Tennemann admits
        the Epistles generally to be genuine (System der Platon. Philos.
        i. p. 106). </p>
      <p>It is undeniable that these Epistles of Plato were recognised
        as genuine and trusted by all the critics of antiquity from
        Aristophanes downwards. Cicero, Plutarch, Aristeides, &amp;c.,
        assert facts upon the authority of the Epistles. Those who
        declare the Epistles to be spurious and worthless, ought in
        consistency to reject the statements which Plutarch makes on the
        authority of the Epistles: they will find themselves compelled
        to discredit some of the best parts of his life of Dion. Compare
        Aristeides, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8172;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; Or. 45, pp. 90-106, Dindorf.</p>

        life until after the restoration of the democracy, nor devote
        himself to philosophy until after the death of Sokrates.</span></p>
    <p>This very natural recital, wherein Plato (at the age of 75)
      describes his own youth between 21 and 28 &#8212; taken in conjunction
      with the other reasons just enumerated &#8212; impresses upon me the
      persuasion, that Plato did not devote himself to philosophy, nor
      publish any of his dialogues, before the death of Sokrates: though
      he may probably have composed dramas, and the beautiful epigrams
      which Diogenes has preserved. He at first frequented the society
      of Sokrates, as many other aspiring young men frequented it
      (likewise that of Kratylus, and perhaps that of various Sophists<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_69" href="#Footnotev1_7_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>),



      from love of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page334"
          id="v1page334"></a>334</span>ethical debate, admiration of
      dialectic power, and desire to acquire a facility of the same kind
      in his own speech: not with any view to take up philosophy as a
      profession, or to undertake the task either of demolishing or
      constructing in the region of speculation. No such resolution was
      adopted until after he had tried political life and had been
      disappointed:&#8212;nor until such disappointment had been still more
      bitterly aggravated by the condemnation of Sokrates. It was under
      this feeling that Plato first consecrated himself to that work of
      philosophical meditation and authorship, &#8212; of inquisitive travel
      and converse with philosophers abroad, &#8212; and ultimately of
      teaching in the Academy, &#8212; which filled up the remaining fifty
      years of his life. The death of Sokrates left that venerated name
      open to be employed as spokesman in his dialogues: and there was
      nothing in the political condition of Athens after 399 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>, analogous to the severe and perilous
      struggle which tasked all the energies of her citizens from 409 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span> down to the close of the war.</p>

        Compare Plat. Protag. 312 A-B, 315 A, where the distinction is
        pointedly drawn between one who visited Protagoras &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#8131;, &#8033;&#962;

        during the fifty-one years after the death of Sokrates.</span></p>
    <p>I believe, on these grounds, that Plato did not publish any
      dialogues during the life of Sokrates. An interval of fifty-one
      years separates the death of Sokrates from that of Plato. Such an
      interval is more than sufficient for all the existing dialogues of
      Plato, without the necessity of going back to a more youthful
      period of his age. As to distribution of the dialogues, earlier or
      later, among these fifty-one years, we have little or no means of
      judging. Plato has kept out of sight &#8212; with a degree of
      completeness which is really surprising &#8212; not merely his own
      personality, but also the marks of special date and the
      determining circumstances in which each dialogue was composed.
      Twice only does he mention his own name, and that simply in
      passing, as if it were the name of a third person.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_70" href="#Footnotev1_7_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a>
      As to the point <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page335"
          id="v1page335"></a>335</span>of time to which he himself
      assigns each dialogue, much discussion has been held how far Plato
      has departed from chronological or historical possibility; how far
      he has brought persons together in Athens who never could have
      been there together, or has made them allude to events posterior
      to their own decease. A speaker in Athen&aelig;us<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_7_71" href="#Footnotev1_7_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
      dwells, with needless acrimony, on the anachronisms of Plato, as
      if they were gross faults. Whether they are faults or not, may
      fairly be doubted: but the fact of such anachronisms cannot be
      doubted, when we have before us the Menexenus and the Symposion.
      It cannot be supposed, in the face of such evidence, that Plato
      took much pains to keep clear of anachronisms: and whether they be
      rather more or rather less numerous, is a question of no great
      moment. </p>

        In the Apologia, c. 28, p. 38, Sokrates alludes to Plato as
        present in court, and as offering to become guarantee, along
        with others, for his fine. In the Ph&aelig;don, Plato is
        mentioned as being sick; to explain why he was not present at
        the last scene of Sokrates (Ph&aelig;don, p. 59 B). Diog. L.
        iii. 37.</p>
      <p>The pathos as well as the detail of the narrative in the
        Ph&aelig;don makes one imagine that Plato really was present at
        the scene. But being obliged, by the uniform scheme of his
        compositions, to provide another narrator, he could not suffer
        it to be supposed that he was himself present. </p>
      <p>I have already remarked that this mention of Plato in the third
        person (&#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#948;&#941;, &#959;&#7990;&#956;&#945;&#953;, &#7968;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;) was probably one of the
        reasons which induced Pan&aelig;tius to declare the Ph&aelig;don
        <i>not</i> to be the work of Plato.</p>

        Athen&aelig;us, v. pp. 220, 221. Didymus also attacked Plato as
        departing from historical truth &#8212; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#966;&#965;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#953; &#8033;&#962;

        630) defends him. Gr&#339;n van Prinsterer, Prosopogr. Plat. p. 16.
        The rhetor Aristeides has some remarks of the same kind, though
        less acrimonious (Orat. xlvii. p. 435, Dind.) than the speaker

        condemned.</span></p>
    <p>I now conclude my enquiry respecting the Platonic Canon. The
      presumption in favour of that Canon, as laid down by Thrasyllus,
      is stronger (as I showed in the preceding <a href="#Platovol1ch6">chapter</a>)
      than it is in regard to ancient authors generally of the same age:
      being traceable, in the last resort, through the Alexandrine
      Museum, to authenticating manuscripts in the Platonic school, and
      to members of that school who had known and cherished Plato
      himself.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_72" href="#Footnotev1_7_72"><span
          class="sp">72</span></a> I have reviewed the doctrines of
      several recent critics who discard this Canon as unworthy of
      trust, and who set up for themselves a type of what Plato <i>must
        have</i> been, derived from a certain number of items in the
      Canon &#8212; rejecting the remaining items as unconformable to their
      hypothetical type. The different theories which they have laid
      down respecting general and systematic purposes of Plato (apart
      from the purpose of each separate composition), appear <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page336" id="v1page336"></a>336</span>to



      me uncertified and gratuitous. The &#8220;internal reasons,&#8221; upon which
      they justify rejection of various dialogues, are only another
      phrase for expressing their own different theories respecting
      Plato as a philosopher and as a writer. For my part I decline to
      discard any item of the Thrasyllean Canon, upon such evidence as
      they produce: I think it a safer and more philosophical proceeding
      to accept the entire Canon, and to accommodate my general theory
      of Plato (in so far as I am able to frame one) to each and all of
      its contents. </p>

        I find this position distinctly asserted, and the authority of
        the Thrasyllean catalogue, as certifying the genuine works of
        Plato, vindicated, by Yxem, in his able dissertation on the
        Kleitophon of Plato (pp. 1-3, Berlin, 1846). But Yxem does not
        set forth the grounds of this opinion so fully as the present
        state of the question demands. Moreover, he combines it with
        another opinion, upon which he insists even at greater length,
        and from which I altogether dissent &#8212; that the tetralogies of
        Thrasyllus exhibit the genuine order established by Plato
        himself among the Dialogues.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_7_37"></a>Unsafe grounds upon which those
        theories proceed. </span></p>
    <p>Considering that Plato&#8217;s period of philosophical composition
      extended over fifty years, and that the circumstances of his life
      are most imperfectly known to us &#8212; it is surely hazardous to limit
      the range of his varieties, on the faith of a critical repugnance,
      not merely subjective and fallible, but withal entirely of modern
      growth: to assume, as basis of reasoning, the admiration raised by
      a few of the finest dialogues &#8212; and then to argue that no
      composition inferior to this admired type, or unlike to it in
      doctrine or handling, can possibly be the work of Plato. &#8220;The
      Minos, Theag&ecirc;s, Epistol&aelig;, Epinomis, &amp;c., are
      unworthy of Plato: nothing so inferior in excellence can have been
      composed by him. No dialogue can be admitted as genuine which
      contradicts another dialogue, or which advocates any low or
      incorrect or un-Platonic doctrine. No dialogue can pass which is
      adverse to the general purpose of Plato as an improver of
      morality, and a teacher of the doctrine of Ideas.&#8221; On such grounds
      as these we are called upon to reject various dialogues: and there
      is nothing upon which, generally speaking, so much stress is laid
      as upon inferior excellence. For my part, I cannot recognise any
      of them as sufficient grounds of exception. I have no difficulty
      in believing, not merely that Plato (like Aristophanes) produced
      many successive novelties, &#8220;not at all similar one to the other,
      and all clever&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_73" href="#Footnotev1_7_73"><span
          class="sp">73</span></a> &#8212; but also that among these
      novelties, there were inferior dialogues as well as superior: that
      in different dialogues he worked out different, even
      contradictory, points of view &#8212; and among them some which critics
      declare to be low and objectionable:<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page337" id="v1page337"></a>337</span> that we have
      among his works unfinished fragments and abandoned sketches,
      published without order, and perhaps only after his death. </p>

        to show this.</span></p>
    <p>It may appear strange, but it is true, that Schleiermacher, the
      leading champion of Plato&#8217;s central purpose and systematic unity
      from the beginning, lays down a doctrine to the same effect. He
      says, &#8220;Truly, nothing can be more preposterous, than when people
      demand that all the works even of a great master shall be of equal
      perfection &#8212; or that such as are not equal, shall be regarded as
      not composed by him&#8221;. Zeller expresses himself in the same manner,
      and with as little reserve.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_74"
        href="#Footnotev1_7_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> These
      eminent critics here proclaim a general rule which neither they
      nor others follow out. </p>

        Schleiermacher, Einleitung zum Menon, vol. iii. p. 337. &#8220;Und
        wahrlich, nichts ist wohl wunderlicher, als wenn man verlangt,
        dass alle Werke auch eines grossen Meisters von gleicher
        Volkommenheit seyn sollten &#8212; oder die es nicht sind, soll er
        nicht verfertigt haben.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Compare Zeller, Phil. d. Griech., vol. ii. p. 322, ed. 2nd. </p>
      <p>It is to be remembered that this opinion of Schleiermacher
        refers only to <i>completed works</i> of the same master. You
        are not authorised in rejecting any completed work as spurious,
        on the ground that it is not equal in merit to some other. Still
        less, then, are you authorised in rejecting, on the like ground,
        an uncompleted work &#8212; a professed fragment, or a preliminary
        sketch. Of this nature are several of the minor items in the
        Thrasyllean canon. </p>
      <p>M. Boeckh, in his Commentary on the dialogue called Minos, has
        assigned the reasons which induce him to throw out that
        dialogue, together with the Hipparchus, from the genuine works
        of Plato (and farther to consider both of them, and the
        pseudo-Platonic dialogues De Justo and De Virtute, as works of
        &#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957; &#8001; &#963;&#954;&#965;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#962;: with this latter hypothesis I have here no
        concern). He admits fully that the Minos is of the Platonic age
        and irreproachable in style &#8212; &#8220;veteris esse et Attici
        scriptoris, probus sermo, antiqui mores totus denique character,
        spondent&#8221; (p. 32). Next, he not only admits that it is like
        Plato, but urges the <i>too great likeness</i> to Plato as one
        of the points of his case. He says that it is a bad, stupid, and
        unskilful imitation of different Platonic dialogues: &#8220;Pergamus
        ad alteram partem nostr&aelig; argumentationis, eamque etiam
        firmiorem, de <i>nimi&acirc; similitudine</i> Platonicorum
        aliquot locorum. Nam de hoc quidem conveniet inter omnes doctos
        et indoctos, Platonem se ipsum haud posse imitari: ni
        fort&eacute; quis dubitet de san&acirc; ejus mente&#8221; (p. 23). In
        the sense which Boeckh intends, I agree that Plato did not
        imitate himself: in another sense, I think that he did. I mean
        that his consummate compositions were preceded by shorter,
        partial, incomplete sketches, which he afterwards worked up,
        improved, and re-modelled. I do not understand how Plato could
        have composed such works as Republic, Protagoras, Gorgias,
        Symposion, Ph&aelig;drus, Ph&aelig;don, &amp;c., without having
        before him many of these preparatory sketches. That some of
        these sketches should have been preserved is what we might
        naturally expect; and I believe Minos and Hipparchus to be among
        them. I do not wonder that they are of inferior merit. One point
        on which Boeckh (pp. 7, 8) contends that Hipparchus and Minos
        are unlike to Plato is, that the <i>collocutor</i> with
        Sokrates is anonymous. But we find anonymous talkers in the
        Protagoras, Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, and Leges.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I find elsewhere in Schleiermacher, another opinion, not less
      important, in reference to disallowance of dialogues, on purely <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page338" id="v1page338"></a>338</span>internal



      grounds. Take the Gorgias and the Protagoras: both these two
      dialogues are among the most renowned of the catalogue: both have
      escaped all suspicion as to legitimacy, even from Ast and Socher,
      the two boldest of all disfranchising critics. In the Protagoras,
      Sokrates maintains an elaborate argument to prove, against the
      unwilling Protagoras, that the Good is identical with the
      Pleasurable, and the Evil identical with the Painful &#8212; in the
      Gorgias, Sokrates holds an argument equally elaborate, to show
      that Good is essentially different from Pleasurable, Evil from
      Painful. What the one affirms, the other denies. Moreover,
      Schleiermacher himself characterises the thesis vindicated by
      Sokrates in the Protagoras, as &#8220;entirely un-Sokratic and
      un-Platonic&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_75" href="#Footnotev1_7_75"><span
          class="sp">75</span></a> If internal grounds of repudiation
      are held to be available against the Thrasyllean canon, how can
      such grounds exist in greater force than those which are here
      admitted to bear against the Protagoras &#8212; That it exhibits
      Sokrates as contradicting the Sokrates of the Gorgias &#8212; That it
      exhibits him farther as advancing and proving, at great length, a
      thesis &#8220;entirely un-Sokratic and un-Platonic&#8221;? Since the critics
      all concur in disregarding these internal objections, as
      insufficient to raise even a suspicion against the Protagoras, I
      cannot concur with them when they urge the like objections as
      valid and irresistible against other dialogues. </p>

        Schleiermacher, Einl. zum Protag. vol. i. p. 232. &#8220;Jene ganz
        unsokratische und unplatonische Ansicht, dass das Gute nichts
        anderes ist als das Angenehme.&#8221; </p>
      <p>So also, in the Parmenides, we find a host of unsolved
        objections against the doctrine of Ideas; upon which in other
        dialogues Plato so emphatically insists. Accordingly, Socher,
        resting upon this discrepancy as an &#8220;internal ground,&#8221; declares
        the Parmenides not to be the work of Plato. But the other
        critics refuse to go along with this inference. I think they are
        right in so refusing. But this only shows how little such
        internal grounds are to be trusted, as evidence to prove
        spuriousness.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I may add, as farther illustrating this point, that there are few
      dialogues in the list against which stronger objections on
      internal grounds can be brought, than Leges and Menexenus. Yet
      both of them stand authenticated, beyond all reasonable dispute,
      as genuine works of Plato, not merely by the Canon of Thrasyllus,
      but also by the testimony of Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_76"

        See Ast, Platon&#8217;s Leben und Schriften, p. 384: and still more,
        Zeller, Plat. Studien, pp. 1-131, T&uuml;bingen, 1839. In that
        treatise, where Zeller has set forth powerfully the grounds for
        denying the genuineness of the Leges, he relied so much upon the
        strength of this negative case, as to discredit the direct
        testimony of Aristotle affirming the Leges to be genuine. In his
        Phil. d. Griech. Zeller altered this opinion, and admitted the
        Leges to be genuine. But Str&uuml;mpell adheres to the earlier
        opinion given by Zeller, and maintains that the partial
        recantation is noway justified. (Gesch. d. Prakt. Phil. d.
        Griech. p. 457.) </p>
      <p>Suckow mentions (Form der Plat. Schriften, 1855, p. 135) that
        Zeller has in a subsequent work reverted to his former opinion,
        denying the genuineness of the Leges. Suckow himself denies it
        also; relying not merely on the internal objections against it,
        but also on a passage of Isokrates (ad Philippum, p. 84), which
        he considers to sanction his opinion, but which (in my judgment)
        entirely fails to bear him out. </p>
      <p>Suckow attempts to show (p. 55), and Ueberweg partly
        countenances the same opinion, that the two passages in which
        Aristotle alludes to the Menexenus (Rhet. i. 9, 30; iii. 14, 11)
        do not prove that he (Aristotle) considered it as a work of
        Plato, because he mentions the name of Sokrates only, and not
        that of Plato. But this is to require from a witness such
        precise specification as we cannot reasonably expect. Aristotle,
        alluding to the Menexenus, says, &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#943;&#8179;: just
        as, in alluding to the Gorgias in another place (Sophist.
        Elench. 12, p. 173), he says, &#922;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#915;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#943;&#8115;: and again,
        in alluding to the Ph&aelig;don, &#8001; &#7952;&#957; &#934;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#969;&#957;&#953; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; (De Gen.
        et Corrupt. ii. 9, p. 335): not to mention his allusions in the
        Politica to the Platonic Republic, under the name of Sokrates.
        No instance can be produced in which Aristotle cites any
        Sokratic dialogue, composed by Antisthenes, &AElig;schines,
        &amp;c., or any other of the Sokratic companions except Plato.
        And when we read in Aristotle&#8217;s Politica (ii. 3, 3) the striking
        compliment paid &#8212; &#932;&#8056; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#959;&#7985; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
        &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#956;&#968;&#972;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;

        imagine that he intends to designate any other dialogues than
        those composed by Plato.</p>
    </div>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page339" id="v1page339"></a>339</span></p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_7_39"
          id="Sidenotev1_7_39"></a>Any true theory of Plato must
        recognise all his varieties, and must be based upon all the
        works in the Canon, not upon some to the exclusion of the rest.</span></p>
    <p>While adhering therefore to the Canon of Thrasyllus, I do not
      think myself obliged to make out that Plato is either like to
      himself, or equal to himself, or consistent with himself,
      throughout all the dialogues included therein, and throughout the
      period of fifty years during which these dialogues were composed.
      Plato is to be found in all and each of the dialogues, not in an
      imaginary type abstracted from some to the exclusion of the rest.
      The critics reverence so much this type of their own creation,
      that they insist on bringing out a result consistent with it,
      either by interpretation specially contrived, or by repudiating
      what will not harmonise. Such sacrifice of the inherent diversity,
      and separate individuality, of the dialogues, to the maintenance
      of a supposed unity of type, style, or purpose, appears to me an
      error. In fact,<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_77" href="#Footnotev1_7_77"><span
          class="sp">77</span></a> there exists, for us, no personal
      Plato any more than <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page340"
          id="v1page340"></a>340</span>there is a personal Shakespeare.
      Plato (except in the Epistol&aelig;) never appears before us, nor
      gives us any opinion as his own: he is the unseen prompter of
      different characters who converse aloud in a number of distinct
      dramas &#8212; each drama a separate work, manifesting its own point of
      view, affirmative or negative, consistent or inconsistent with the
      others, as the case may be. In so far as I venture to present a
      general view of one who keeps constantly in the dark &#8212; who
      delights to dive, and hide himself, not less difficult to catch
      than the supposed Sophist in his own dialogue called
      Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212; I shall consider it as subordinate to the
      dialogues, each and all: and above all, it must be such as to
      include and acknowledge not merely diversities, but also
      inconsistencies and contradictions.<a name="FnAnchorv1_7_78"

        The only manifestation of the personal Plato is in the
        Epistol&aelig;. I have already said that I accept these as
        genuine, though most critics do not. I consider them valuable
        illustrations of his character, as far as they go. They are all
        written after he was more than sixty years of age. And most of
        them relate to his relations with Dionysius the younger, with
        Dion, and with Sicilian affairs generally. This was a peculiar
        and outlying phase of Plato&#8217;s life, during which (through the
        instigation of Dion, and at the sacrifice of his own peace of
        mind) he became involved in the world of political action: he
        had to deal with real persons, passions, and interests &#8212; with
        the feeble character, literary velleities, and jealous
        apprehensions of Dionysius &#8212; the reforming vehemence and
        unpopular harshness of Dion &#8212; the courtiers, the soldiers, and
        the people of Syracuse, all moved by different passions of which
        he had had no practical experience. It could not be expected
        that, amidst such turbulent elements, Plato as an adviser could
        effect much: yet I do not think that he turned his chances,
        doubtful as they were, to the best account. I have endeavoured
        to show this in the tenth volume of my History of Greece, c. 84.
        But at all events, these operations lay apart from Plato&#8217;s true
        world &#8212; the speculation, dialectic, and lectures of the Academy
        at Athens. The Epistol&aelig;, however, present some instructive
        points, bearing upon Plato&#8217;s opinions about writing as a medium
        of philosophical communication and instruction to learners,
        which I shall notice in the suitable place.</p>

        I transcribe from the instructive work of M. Ernest Renan, <i>Averro&egrave;s



          et l&#8217;Averro&iuml;sme</i>, a passage in which he deprecates the
        proceeding of critics who presume uniform consistency throughout
        the works of Aristotle, and make out their theory partly by
        forcible exegesis, partly by setting aside as spurious all those
        compositions which oppose them. The remark applies more forcibly
        to the dialogues or Plato, who is much less systematic than
        Aristotle:&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;On a combattu l&#8217;interpr&eacute;tation d&#8217;Ibn-Rosehd
        (Averro&egrave;s), et soutenu que l&#8217;intellect actif n&#8217;est pour
        Aristote qu&#8217;une facult&eacute; de l&#8217;ame. L&#8217;intellect passif
        n&#8217;est alors que la facult&eacute; de recevoir les &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;:
        l&#8217;intellect actif n&#8217;est que l&#8217;induction s&#8217;exer&ccedil;ant sur
        les &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; et en tirant les id&eacute;es
        g&eacute;n&eacute;rales. Ainsi l&#8217;on fait concorder la
        th&eacute;orie expos&eacute;e dans le troisi&egrave;me livre du
        Trait&eacute; de l&#8217;Ame, avec celle des Seconds Analytiques,
        o&ugrave; Aristote semble r&eacute;duire le r&ocirc;le de la
        raison &agrave; l&#8217;induction g&eacute;n&eacute;ralisant les faits
        de la sensation. Certes, je ne me dissimule pas qu&#8217;Aristote
        para&icirc;t souvent envisager le &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; comme personnel &agrave;
        l&#8217;homme. Son attention constante &agrave; rep&eacute;ter que
        l&#8217;intellect est identique &agrave; l&#8217;intelligible, que
        l&#8217;intellect passe &agrave; l&#8217;acte quand il devient l&#8217;objet qu&#8217;il
        pense, est difficile &agrave; concilier avec l&#8217;hypoth&egrave;se
        d&#8217;un intellect s&eacute;par&eacute; de l&#8217;homme. Mais il est
        dangereux de faire ainsi coincider de force les
        diff&eacute;rents aper&ccedil;us des anciens. Les anciens
        philosophaient souvent sans se limiter dans un syst&egrave;me,
        traitant le m&ecirc;me sujet selon les points de vue qui
        s&#8217;offraient &agrave; eux, ou qui leur &eacute;taient offerts par
        les &eacute;coles ant&eacute;rieures, sans s&#8217;inqui&eacute;ter
        des dissonances qui pouvaient exister entre ces divers
        tron&ccedil;ons de th&eacute;orie. Il est pu&eacute;ril de
        chercher &agrave; les mettre d&#8217;accord avec eux-m&ecirc;mes,
        quand eux-m&ecirc;mes s&#8217;en sont peu souci&eacute;s. Autant
        vaudrait, comme certains critiques Allemands, d&eacute;clarer
        interpol&eacute;s tous les passages que l&#8217;on ne peut concilier
        avec les autres. Ainsi, la th&eacute;orie des Seconds

      <p>There is also in Str&uuml;mpell (Gesch. der Prakt. Phil. der
        Griech. vor Aristot. p. 200) a good passage to the same purpose
        as the above from M. Renan: disapproving this presumption, &#8212;
        that the doctrines of every ancient philosopher must of course
        be systematic and coherent with each other &#8212; as &#8220;a phantom of
        modern times&#8221;: and pointing out that both Plato and Aristotle
        founded their philosophy, not upon any one governing &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; alone,
        from which exclusively consequences are deduced, but upon
        several distinct, co-ordinate, independent, points of view: each
        of which is by turns followed out, not always consistently with
        the others.</p>

    <p>On looking through the collection of works enumerated in the
      Thrasyllean Canon, the first impression made upon us respecting
      the author is, that which is expressed in the epithets applied to
      him by Cicero &#8212; &#8220;varius et multiplex et copiosus&#8221;. Such epithets
      bring before us the variety in Plato&#8217;s points of view and methods
      of handling &#8212; the multiplicity of the topics discussed &#8212; the
      abundance of the premisses and illustrations suggested:<a

        The rhetor Aristeides, comparing Plato with &AElig;schines (<i>i.e.</i>
        &AElig;schines Socraticus, disciple of Sokrates also), remarks
        that &AElig;schines was more likely to report what Sokrates
        really said, from being inferior in productive imagination.
        Plato (as he truly says Orat. xlvi. &#8025;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#932;&#949;&#964;&#964;&#940;&#961;&#969;&#957;, p. 295,

    <p>Several critics of antiquity considered Plato as essentially a
      sceptic &#8212; that is, a Searcher or Enquirer, not reaching any
      assured or proved result. They denied to him the character of a
      dogmatist: they maintained that he neither established nor
      enforced any affirmative doctrines.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_2"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> This latter
      statement is carried too far. Plato is sceptical in some
      dialogues, dogmatical in others. And the catalogue of Thrasyllus
      shows that the sceptical dialogues (Dialogues of Search or
      Investigation) are more numerous than the dogmatical (Dialogues of
      Exposition) &#8212; as they are also, speaking generally, more animated
      and interesting. </p>

        compositions, but not in all.</span></p>
    <p>Again, Aristotle declared the writing of Plato to be something
      between poetry and prose, and even the philosophical doctrine of
      Plato respecting Ideas, to derive all its apparent plausibility
      from poetic metaphors. The affirmation is true, up to a certain
      point. Many of the dialogues display an exuberant vein of poetry,
      which was declared &#8212; not by Aristotle alone, but by many other
      critics contemporary with Plato &#8212; to be often misplaced and
      excessive &#8212; and which appeared the more striking because the
      dialogues composed by the other Sokratic companions were all of
      them plain and unadorned.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_3"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The various
      mythes, in the Ph&aelig;drus and elsewhere, are announced
      expressly as soaring above the conditions of truth and logical
      appreciation. Moreover, we find occasionally an amount of dramatic
      vivacity, and of artistic antithesis between the speakers
      introduced, which might have enabled Plato, had he composed for
      the drama as a profession, to contend with success for the prizes
      at the Dionysiac festivals. But here again, though this is true of
      several dialogues, it is not true of others. In the
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, Tim&aelig;us, and the Leges, such elements will
      be looked for in vain. In the Tim&aelig;us, they are exchanged for
      a professed cosmical system, including much mystic and oracular
      affirmation, without proof to support it, and without opponents to
      test it: in the Leges, for ethical <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page344" id="v1page344"></a>344</span>sermons, and
      religious fulminations, proclaimed by a dictatorial authority. </p>

      <p>The Greek rhetors of the Augustan age &#8212; Dionysius of
        Halikarnassus and K&aelig;kilius of Kalakt&ecirc; &#8212; not only
        blamed the style of Plato for excessive, overstrained, and
        misplaced metaphor, but K&aelig;kilius goes so far as to declare
        a decided preference for Lysias over Plato. (Dionys. Hal. De Vi
        Demosth. pp. 1025-1037, De Comp. Verb. p. 196 R; Longinus, De
        Sublimitat. c. 32.) The number of critics who censured the
        manner and doctrine of Plato (critics both contemporary with him
        and subsequent) was considerable (Dionys. H. Ep. ad Pomp. p.
        757). Dionysius and the critics of his age had before their eyes
        the contrast of the Asiatic style of rhetoric, prevalent in
        their time, with the Attic style represented by Demosthenes and
        Lysias. They wished to uphold the force and simplicity of the
        Attic, against the tumid, wordy, pretensive Asiatic: and they
        considered the Ph&aelig;drus, with other compositions of Plato,
        as falling under the same censure with the Asiatic. See Theoph.
        Burckhardt, C&aelig;cili Rhet. Frag., Berlin, 1863, p. 15.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_4"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_4"></a>Form of dialogue &#8212; universal to this
        extent, that Plato never speaks in his own name.</span></p>
    <p>One feature there is, which is declared by Schleiermacher and
      others to be essential to all the works of Plato &#8212; the form of
      dialogue. Here Schleiermacher&#8217;s assertion, literally taken, is
      incontestable. Plato always puts his thoughts into the mouth of
      some spokesman: he never speaks in his own name. All the works of
      Plato which we possess (excepting the Epistles, and the Apology,
      which last I consider to be a report of what Sokrates himself
      said) are dialogues. But under this same name, many different
      realities are found to be contained. In the Tim&aelig;us and
      Kritias the dialogue is simply introductory to a continuous
      exposition &#8212; in the Menexenus, to a rhetorical discourse: while in
      the Leges, and even in Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, and others, it
      includes no antithesis nor interchange between two independent
      minds, but is simply a didactic lecture, put into interrogatory
      form, and broken into fragments small enough for the listener to
      swallow at once: he by his answer acknowledging the receipt. If
      therefore the affirmation of Schleiermacher is intended to apply
      to all the Platonic compositions, we must confine it to the form,
      without including the spirit, of dialogue. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_5"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_5"></a>No one common characteristic pervading
        all Plato&#8217;s works.</span></p>
    <p>It is in truth scarcely possible to resolve all the diverse
      manifestations of the Platonic mind into one higher unity; or to
      predicate, about Plato as an intellectual person, anything which
      shall be applicable at once to the Protagoras, Gorgias,
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, Ph&aelig;drus, Symposion, Phil&ecirc;bus,
      Ph&aelig;don, Republic, Tim&aelig;us, and Leges. Plato was
      sceptic, dogmatist, religious mystic and inquisitor,
      mathematician, philosopher, poet (erotic as well as satirical),
      rhetor, artist &#8212; all in one:<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_4"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> or at
      least, all in succession, throughout <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page345" id="v1page345"></a>345</span>the fifty years
      of his philosophical life. At one time his exuberant dialectical
      impulse claims satisfaction, manifesting itself in a string of
      ingenious doubts and unsolved contradictions: at another time, he
      is full of theological antipathy against those who libel Helios
      and Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc;, or who deny the universal providence of
      the Gods: here, we have unqualified confessions of ignorance, and
      protestations against the false persuasion of knowledge, as alike
      widespread and deplorable &#8212; there, we find a description of the
      process of building up the Kosmos from the beginning, as if the
      author had been privy to the inmost purposes of the Demiurgus. In
      one dialogue the erotic fever is in the ascendant, distributed
      between beautiful youths and philosophical concepts, and
      confounded with a religious inspiration and <i>furor</i> which
      supersedes and transcends human sobriety (Ph&aelig;drus): in
      another, all vehement impulses of the soul are stigmatised and
      repudiated, no honourable scope being left for anything but the
      calm and passionless Nous (Phil&ecirc;bus, Ph&aelig;don). Satire
      is exchanged for dithyramb, and mythe, and one ethical point of
      view for another (Protagoras, Gorgias). The all-sufficient
      dramatising power of the master gives full effect to each of these
      multifarious tendencies. On the whole &#8212; to use a comparison of
      Plato himself<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_5" href="#Footnotev1_8_5"><span
          class="sp">5</span></a> &#8212; the Platonic sum total somewhat
      resembles those fanciful combinations of animals imagined in the
      Hellenic mythology &#8212; an aggregate of distinct and disparate
      individualities, which look like one because they are packed in
      the same external wrapper. </p>

        Dik&aelig;archus affirmed that Plato was a compound of Sokrates
        with Pythagoras. Plutarch calls him also a compound of Sokrates
        with Lykurgus. (Plutarch, Symposiac. viii. 2, p. 718 B.)</p>
      <p>Nemesius the Platonist (Eusebius, Pr&aelig;p. Evang. xiv.
        5-7-8) repeats the saying of Dik&aelig;archus, and describes
        Plato as midway between Pythagoras and Sokrates; &#956;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#973;&#969;&#957;
        &#928;&#965;&#952;&#945;&#947;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962;. No three persons could be more
        disparate than Lykurgus, Pythagoras, and Sokrates. But there are
        besides various other attributes of Plato, which are not
        included under either of the heads of this tripartite character.</p>
      <p>The Stoic philosopher Sph&aelig;rus composed a work in three
        books &#8212; &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#923;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#8212; (Diog. La. vii. 178). He
        probably compared therein the Platonic Republic with the Spartan
        constitution and discipline.</p>

      celebrity for the last half (nearly forty years) of his life, was

      it. The little information which we possess respecting Plato&#8217;s
      lectures, relates altogether to those which he delivered upon the
      Ipsum Bonum or Summum Bonum at some time after Aristotle became
      his <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page347" id="v1page347"></a>347</span>pupil



      &#8212; that is, during the last eighteen years of Plato&#8217;s life.
      Aristotle and other hearers took notes of these lectures:
      Aristotle even composed an express work now lost (De Bono or De
      Philosophi&acirc;), reporting with comments of his own these oral
      doctrines of Plato, together with the analogous doctrines of the
      Pythagoreans. We learn that Plato gave continuous lectures,
      dealing with the highest and most transcendental concepts (with
      the constituent elements or factors of the Platonic Ideas or Ideal
      Numbers: the first of these factors being The One &#8212; the second,
      The Indeterminate Dyad, or The Great and Little, the essentially
      indefinite), and that they were mystic and enigmatical, difficult
      to understand.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_8" href="#Footnotev1_8_8"><span

        Trendelenburg not only adopts Schleiermacher&#8217;s theory of a
        preconceived and systematic purpose connecting together all
        Plato&#8217;s dialogues, but even extends this purpose to Plato&#8217;s oral
        lectures: &#8220;Id pro certo habendum est. sicut prioribus dialogis
        quasi pr&aelig;eparat (Plato) posteriores, posterioribus evolvit
        priores &#8212; ita et in scholis continuasse dialogos; qu&aelig;
        reliquerit, absolvisse; atque omnibus ad summa principia
        perductis, intima quasi semina aperuisse&#8221;. (Trendelenburg, De
        Ideis et Numeris Platonis, p. 6.)</p>
      <p>This opinion is surely not borne out &#8212; it seems even
        contradicted &#8212; by all the information which we possess (very
        scanty indeed) about the Platonic lectures. Plato delivered
        therein his Pythagorean doctrines, merging his Ideas in the
        Pythagorean numerical symbols: and Aristotle, far from
        considering this as a systematic and intended evolution of
        doctrine at first imperfectly unfolded, treats it as an
        additional perversion and confusion, introduced into a doctrine
        originally erroneous. In regard to the transition of Plato from
        the doctrine of Ideas to that of Ideal Numbers, see Aristotel.
        Metaphys. M. 1078, b. 9, 1080, a. 12 (with the commentary of
        Bonitz, pp. 539-541), A. 987, b. 20. </p>
      <p>M. Boeckh, too, accounts for the obscure and enigmatical
        speaking of Plato in various dialogues, by supposing that he
        cleared up all the difficulties in his oral lectures. &#8220;Platon
        deutet nur an &#8212; spricht meinethalben r&auml;thselhaft (in den
        Gesetzen); aber gerade so r&auml;thselhaft spricht er von diesen
        Sachen im Timaeus: er pflegt mathematische Theoreme nur
        anzudeuten, nicht zu entwickeln: ich glaube, weil er sie in den
        Vortr&auml;gen ausf&uuml;hrte,&#8221; &amp;c. (Untersuchungen
        &uuml;ber das Kosmische System des Platon, p. 50.) </p>
      <p>This may be true about the mathematical theorems; but I confess
        that I see no proof of it. Though Plato admits that his doctrine
        in the Tim&aelig;us is &#7936;&#942;&#952;&#951;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;, yet he expressly intimates
        that the hearers are instructed persons, able to follow him
        (Tim&aelig;us, p. 53 C.).</p>

        M. Renan, in his work, &#8216;Averro&egrave;s et l&#8217;Averro&iuml;sme,&#8217;
        pp. 257-325, remarks that several of the Italian professors of
        philosophy, at Padua and other universities, exercised far
        greater influence through their lectures than through their
        published works. He says (p. 325-6) respecting Cremonini
        (Professor at Padua, 1590-1620):&#8212;&#8220;Il a &eacute;t&eacute;
        jusqu&#8217;ici appr&eacute;ci&eacute; d&#8217;une mani&egrave;re fort
        incompl&egrave;te par les historiens de la philosophie. On ne
        l&#8217;a jug&eacute; que par ses &eacute;crits imprim&eacute;s, qui
        ne sont que des dissertations de peu d&#8217;importance, et ne peuvent
        en aucune mani&egrave;re faire comprendre la renomm&eacute;e
        colossale &agrave; laquelle il parvint. Cremonini n&#8217;est qu&#8217;un
        professeur: ses <i>cours</i> sont sa v&eacute;ritable
        philosophie. Aussi, tandis que ses &eacute;crits imprim&eacute;s
        se vendaient fort mal, les r&eacute;dactions de ses
        le&ccedil;ons se r&eacute;pandaient dans toute l&#8217;Italie et
        m&ecirc;me au del&agrave; des monts. On sait que les
        &eacute;l&egrave;ves pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent souvent aux textes
        imprim&eacute;s, les cahiers qu&#8217;ils ont ainsi recueillis de la
        bouche de leurs professeurs.&#8230; En g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, c&#8217;est
        dans les cahiers, beaucoup plus que dans les sources
        imprim&eacute;es, qu&#8217;il faut &eacute;tudier l&#8217;&eacute;cole de
        Padoue. Pour Cremonini, cette t&acirc;che est facile; car les
        copies de ses cours sont innombrables dans le nord de l&#8217;Italie.&#8221;</p>

        auditors. They coincide mainly with what Aristotle states about
        the Platonic Ideas.</span></p>
    <p>We see farther from this remark:&#8212;First, that Plato&#8217;s lectures
      were often above what his auditors could appreciate &#8212; a fact which
      we learn from other allusions also: Next, that they were not

      Had such been the case, the surprise which Aristotle mentions
      could never have been felt. And we see farther, that the
      transcendental doctrine delivered in the lectures De Bono (though
      we find partial analogies to it in Phil&ecirc;bus, Epinomis, and
      parts of Republic) coincides more with what Aristotle states and
      comments upon as Platonic doctrine, than with any reasonings which
      we find in the Platonic dialogues. It represents the latest phase
      of Platonism: when the Ideas originally conceived by him as
      Entities in themselves, had become merged or identified in his
      mind with the Pythagorean numbers or symbols. </p>

        Respecting Plato&#8217;s lectures, see Brandis (Gesch. der
        Griech.-R&ouml;m. Phil. vol. ii. p. 180 seq., 306-319); also
        Trendelenburg, Platonis De Ideis et Numeris Doctrina, pp. 3, 4,
        seq. </p>
      <p>Brandis, though he admits that Plato&#8217;s lectures were continuous
        discourses, thinks that they were intermingled with discussion
        and debate: which may have been the case, though there is no
        proof of it. But Schleiermacher goes further, and says
        (Einleitung. p. 18), &#8220;Any one who can think that Plato in these
        oral <i>Vortr&auml;gen</i> employed the Sophistical method of
        long speeches, shows such an ignorance as to forfeit all right
        of speaking about Plato&#8221;. Now the passage from Aristoxenus,
        given in the preceding note, is our only testimony; and it
        distinctly indicates a continuous lecture to an unprepared
        auditory, just as Protagoras or Prodikus might have given. K. F.
        Hermann protests, with good reason, against Schleiermacher&#8217;s
        opinion. (Ueber Plato&#8217;s schriftstellerische Motive, p. 289.)</p>
      <p>The confident declaration just produced from Schleiermacher
        illustrates the unsound basis on which he and various other
        Platonic critics proceed. They find, in some dialogues of Plato,
        a strong opinion proclaimed, that continuous discourse is
        useless for the purpose of instruction. This was a point of view
        which, at the time when he composed these dialogues, he
        considered to be of importance, and desired to enforce. But we
        are not warranted in concluding that he must always have held
        the same conviction throughout his long philosophical life, and
        in rejecting as un-platonic all statements and all compositions
        which imply an opposite belief. We cannot with reason bind down
        Plato to a persistence in one and the same type of compositions.</p>

    <p>This statement of Aristotle, alike interesting and
      unquestionable, attests the mysticism and obscurity which pervaded
      Plato&#8217;s doctrine in his later years. But whether this lecture on <i>The



        Good</i> is to be taken as a fair specimen of Plato&#8217;s lecturing
      generally, and from the time when he first began to lecture, we
      may perhaps doubt:<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_11"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> since we
      know that as a lecturer and converser he acquired extraordinary
      ascendency over ardent youth. We see this by the remarkable
      instance of Dion.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_12" href="#Footnotev1_8_12"><span

        Themistius says (Orat. xxi. p. 245 D) that Plato sometimes
        lectured in the Peir&aelig;us, and that a crowd then collected
        to hear him, not merely from the city, but also from the country
        around: if he lectured De Bono, however, the ordinary hearers
        became tired and dispersed, leaving only &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#8001;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#940;&#962;.</p>
      <p>It appears that Plato in his lectures delivered theories on the
        principles of geometry. He denied the reality of geometrical
        points &#8212; or at least admitted them only as hypotheses for
        geometrical reasoning. He maintained that what others called <i>a
          point</i> ought to be called &#8220;<i>an indivisible line</i>&#8221;.
        Xenokrates maintained the same doctrine after him. Aristotle
        controverts it (see Metaphys. A., 992, b. 20). Aristotle&#8217;s words
        citing Plato&#8217;s opinion (&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#949;&#956;&#940;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#959;
        &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#953; &#947;&#949;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8183; &#948;&#972;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217; &#7952;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052;&#957;

        must be referred to Plato&#8217;s oral lectures; no such opinion
        occurs in the dialogues. This is the opinion both of Bonitz and
        Schwegler in their comments on the passage: also of
        Trendelenburg, De Ideis et Numeris Platonis, p. 66. That
        geometry and arithmetic were matters of study and reflection
        both to Plato himself and to many of his pupils in the Academy,
        appears certain; and perhaps Plato may have had an interior
        circle of pupils, to which he applied the well-known exclusion &#8212;
        &#956;&#951;&#948;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#949;&#969;&#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#969;. But we cannot make out clearly what
        was Plato&#8217;s own proficiency, or what improvements he may have
        introduced, in geometry, nor what there is to justify the
        comparison made by Montucla between Plato and Descartes. In the
        narrative respecting the Delian problem &#8212; the duplication of the
        cube &#8212; Archytas, Men&aelig;chmus, and Eudoxus, appear as the
        inventors of solutions, Plato as the superior who prescribes and
        criticises (see the letter and epigram of Eratosthenes:
        Bernhardy, Eratosthenica, pp. 176-184). The three are said to
        have been blamed by Plato for substituting instrumental
        measurement in place of geometrical proof (Plutarch, Problem.
        Sympos. viii. 2, pp. 718, 719; Plutarch, Vit. Marcelli, c. 14).
        The geometrical construction of the &#922;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;, which Plato gives us
        in the Tim&aelig;us, seems borrowed from the Pythagoreans,
        though applied probably in a way peculiar to himself (see
        Finger, De Primordiis Geometri&aelig; ap. Gr&aelig;cos, p. 38,
        Heidelb. 1831).</p>

        Of the thirteen Platonic Epistles, Ep. 2, 3, 13, are addressed
        to the second or younger Dionysius; Ep. 4 to Dion; Ep. 7, 8, to
        the friends and relatives of Dion after Dion&#8217;s death. The 13th
        Epistle appears to be the earliest of all, being seemingly
        written after the first voyage of Plato to visit Dionysius II.
        at Syracuse, in 367-366 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and
        before his second visit to the same place and person, about
        363-362 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Epistles 2 and 3 were
        written after his return from that second visit, in 360 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and prior to the expedition of Dion
        against Dionysius in 357 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        Epistle 4 was written to Dion shortly after Dion&#8217;s victorious
        career at Syracuse, about 355 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        Epistles 7 and 8 were written not long after the murder of Dion
        in 354 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The first in order,
        among the Platonic Epistles, is not written by Plato, but by
        Dion, addressed to Dionysius, shortly after the latter had sent
        Dion away from Syracuse. The fifth is addressed by Plato to the
        Macedonian prince Perdikkas. The sixth, to Hermeias of Atarneus,
        Erastus, and Koriskus. The ninth and twelfth, to Archytas of
        Tarentum. The tenth, to Aristod&ocirc;rus. The eleventh, to
        Laodamas. I confess that I see nothing in these letters which
        compels me to depart from the judgment of the ancient critics,
        who unanimously acknowledged them as genuine. I do not think
        myself competent to determine <i>&agrave; priori</i> what the
        style of Plato&#8217;s letters <i>must</i> have been; what topics he
        <i>must</i> have touched upon, and what topics he <i>could not</i>
        have touched upon. I have no difficulty in believing that Plato,
        writing a letter on philosophy, may have expressed himself with
        as much mysticism and obscurity as we now read in Epist. 2 and
        7. Nor does it surprise me to find Plato (in Epist. 13) alluding
        to details which critics, who look upon him altogether as a
        spiritual person, disallow as mean and unworthy. His
        recommendation of the geometer, Helikon of Kyzikus, to Dionysius
        and Archytas, is to me interesting: to make known the theorems
        of Eudoxus, through the medium of Helikon, to Archytas, was no
        small service to geometry in those days. I have an interest in
        learning how Plato employed the money given to him by Dionysius
        and other friends: that he sent to Dionysius a statue of Apollo
        by a good Athenian sculptor named Leochares (this sculptor
        executed a bust of Isokrates also, Plut. Vit. x. Orat. p. 838);
        and another statue by the same sculptor for the wife of
        Dionysius, in gratitude for the care which she had taken of him
        (Plato) when sick at Syracuse; that he spent the money of
        Dionysius partly in discharging his own public taxes and
        liturgies at Athens, partly in providing dowries for poor
        maidens among his friends; that he was so beset by applications,
        which he could not refuse, for letters of recommendation to
        Dionysius, as to compel him to signify, by a private mark, to
        Dionysius, which among the letters he wished to be most attended
        to. &#8220;These latter&#8221; (he says) &#8220;I shall begin with &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; (sing.
        number), the others I shall begin with &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8054; (plural).&#8221; (Epist.

    <p>Knowing as we do that he had largely imbued himself with the

      cited as an exception to their rule &#8212; and did not care to be
      understood, except by their own adepts after a long

      language very similar. He declares that the highest principles of

      could not be set forth in writing so as to be intelligible to

    </div>
    <p>Plato during his second visit had had one conversation, and only
      one, with Dionysius respecting the higher mysteries of philosophy.
      He had impressed upon Dionysius the prodigious labour and
      difficulty of attaining truth upon these matters. The despot
      professed to thirst ardently for philosophy, and the conversation
      turned upon the Natura Primi &#8212; upon the first and highest
      principles of Nature.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_15"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
      Dionysius, after this conversation with Plato, intimated that he
      had already conceived in his own mind the solution of these
      difficulties, and the truth upon philosophy in its greatest
      mysteries. Upon which Plato expressed his satisfaction that such
      was the case,<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_16" href="#Footnotev1_8_16"><span

      difficulties again crowded upon him &#8212; and that it was necessary to
      send a confidential messenger to Athens to entreat farther
      elucidations. In reply, Plato sends back by the messenger what is
      now numbered as the second of his Epistles. He writes avowedly in
      enigmatical language, so that, if the letter be lost, the finder
      will not be able to understand it; and he enjoins Dionysius to
      burn it after frequent perusal.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_17"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> He
      expresses his hope that when Dionysius has debated the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page352" id="v1page352"></a>352</span>matter



      often with the best minds near him, the clouds will clear away of
      themselves, and the moment of illumination will supervene.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_18" href="#Footnotev1_8_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
      He especially warns Dionysius against talking about these matters
      to unschooled men, who will be sure to laugh at them; though by
      minds properly prepared, they will be received with the most
      fervent welcome.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_19" href="#Footnotev1_8_19"><span
          class="sp">19</span></a> He affirms that Dionysius is much
      superior in philosophical debate to his companions; who were
      overcome in debate with him, not because they suffered themselves
      designedly to be overcome (out of flattery towards the despot, as
      some ill-natured persons alleged), but because they could not
      defend themselves against the Elenchus as applied by Dionysius.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_20" href="#Footnotev1_8_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
      Lastly, Plato advises Dionysius to write down nothing, since what
      has once been written will be sure to disappear from the memory;
      but to trust altogether to learning by heart, meditation, and
      repeated debate, as a guarantee for retention in his mind. &#8220;It is
      for that reason&#8221; (Plato says)<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_21"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> &#8220;that I
      have never myself written anything upon these subjects. There
      neither is, nor shall there ever be, any treatise of Plato. The
      opinions called by the name of Plato are those of Sokrates, in his
      days of youthful vigour and glory.&#8221; </p>

    <p>Such is the language addressed by Plato to the younger Dionysius,
      in a letter written seemingly between 362-357 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
      In another letter, written about ten years afterwards (353-352 <span
        class="smcap">B.C.</span>) to the friends of Dion (after Dion&#8217;s
      death), he expresses the like repugnance to the idea of furnishing
      any written authoritative exposition of his principal doctrines.
      &#8220;There never shall be any expository treatise of mine upon them&#8221;
      (he declares). &#8220;Others have tried, Dionysius among the number, to
      write them down; but they do not know what they attempt. I <span

      myself do this better than any one, and I should consider it the
      proudest deed in my life, as well as a signal benefit to mankind,
      to bring forward an exposition of Nature luminous to all.<a

      But I think the attempt would be nowise beneficial, except to a
      few, who require only slight direction to enable them to find it
      for themselves: to most persons it would do no good, but would
      only fill them with empty conceit of knowledge, and with contempt

      <p>This sentence, as a remarkable one, I have translated literally
        in the text: that which precedes is given only in substance.</p>
      <p>We see in the Republic that Sokrates, when questioned by
        Glaukon, and urged emphatically to give some solution respecting
        &#7969; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166; &#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945; and &#7969; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;, answers only by
        an evasion or a metaphor (Republic, vi. 506 E, vii. 533 A). Now
        these are much the same points as what are signified in the
        letter to Dionysius, under the terms &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#954;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962;

        the creeping in of error at each of these stages.</span></p>
    <p>Plato then proceeds to give an example from geometry,
      illustrating the uselessness both of writing and of direct
      exposition. In acquiring a knowledge of the circle, he
      distinguishes five successive stages. 1. The Name. 2. The
      Definition, a proposition composed of nouns and verbs. 3. The
      Diagram. 4. Knowledge, Intelligence, True Opinion, &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;. 5. The

      fourth stage is a purely mental result, not capable of being
      exposed either in words or figure: it presupposes the three first,
      but is something distinct from them; and it is the only mental
      condition immediately cognate and similar to the fifth stage, or
      the self-existent idea.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_26"

    <p>Now in all three first stages (Plato says) there is great
      liability to error and confusion. The name is unavoidably
      equivocal, uncertain, fluctuating: the definition is open to the
      same reproach, and often gives special and accidental properties
      along with the universal and essential, or instead of them: the
      diagram cannot exhibit the essential without some variety of the
      accidental, nor without some properties even contrary to reality,
      since any circle which you draw, instead of touching a straight
      line in one point alone, will be sure to touch it in several
      points.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_27" href="#Footnotev1_8_27"><span

      this, we have the <i>quid</i> or essence, which we are searching

      We acquire only a confused cognition, exposing us to be puzzled,
      confuted, and humiliated, by an acute cross-examiner, when he
      questions us on the four stages which we have gone through to
      attain it.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_30" href="#Footnotev1_8_30"><span

      any fault in the mind, but from the defects inherent in each of
      the four stages of progress. It is only by painful effort, when
      each of these is naturally good &#8212; when the mind itself also is
      naturally good, and when it has gone through all the stages up and
      down, dwelling upon each &#8212; that true knowledge can be acquired.<a

      Persons whose minds are naturally bad, or have become corrupt,
      morally or intellectually, cannot be taught to see even by Lynkeus
      himself. In a word, if the mind itself be not cognate to the
      matter studied, no quickness in learning nor force of memory <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page355" id="v1page355"></a>355</span>will



      suffice. He who is a quick learner and retentive, but not cognate
      or congenial with just or honourable things &#8212; he who, though
      cognate and congenial, is stupid in learning or forgetful &#8212; will
      never effectually learn the truth about virtue or wickedness.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_32" href="#Footnotev1_8_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
      These can only be learnt along with truth and falsehood as it

      It is only with difficulty, &#8212; after continued friction, one
      against another, of all the four intellectual helps, names and
      definitions, acts of sight and sense, &#8212; after application of the
      Elenchus by repeated question and answer, in a friendly temper and
      without spite &#8212; it is only after all these preliminaries, that
      cognition and intelligence shine out with as much intensity as

        and the friends of the deceased Dion. Pretensions of Dionysius
        to understand and expound Plato&#8217;s doctrines.</span></p>
    <p>We see by these letters that Plato disliked and disapproved the
      idea of publishing, for the benefit of readers generally, any
      written exposition of <i>philosophia prima</i>, carrying his own
      name, and making him responsible for it. His writings are
      altogether dramatic. All opinions on philosophy are enunciated
      through one or other of his spokesmen: that portion of the
      Athenian drama called the Parabasis, in which the Chorus addressed
      the audience directly and avowedly in the name of the poet, found
      no favour with Plato. We read indeed in several of his <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page356" id="v1page356"></a>356</span>dialogues



      (Ph&aelig;don, Republic, Tim&aelig;us, and others) dogmas advanced
      about the highest and most recondite topics of philosophy: but
      then they are all advanced under the name of Sokrates,
      Tim&aelig;us, &amp;c. &#8212; &#927;&#8016;&#954; &#7952;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#8001; &#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962;, &amp;c. There never was
      any written programme issued by Plato himself, declaring the
      Symbolum Fidei to which he attached his own name.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_36" href="#Footnotev1_8_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
      Even in the Leges, the most dogmatical of all his works, the
      dramatic character and the borrowed voice are kept up. Probably at
      the time when Plato wrote his letter to the friends of the
      deceased Dion, from which I have just quoted &#8212; his aversion to
      written expositions was aggravated by the fact, that Dionysius
      II., or some friend in his name, had written and published a
      philosophical treatise of this sort, passing himself off as editor
      of a Platonic philosophy, or of improved doctrines of his own
      built thereupon, from oral communication with Plato.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_37" href="#Footnotev1_8_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
      We must remember that Plato himself (whether with full sincerity
      or not) had complimented Dionysius for his natural ability and
      aptitude in philosophical debate:<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_38"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> so that
      the pretension of the latter to come forward as an expositor of
      Plato appears the less preposterous. On the other hand, such
      pretension was calculated to raise a belief that Dionysius had
      been among the most favoured and confidential companions of Plato:
      which belief Plato, writing as he was to the surviving friends of
      Dion the enemy of Dionysius, is most anxious to remove, while on
      the other hand he extols the dispositions and extenuates the
      faults of his friend Dion. It is to vindicate himself from
      misconception of his own past proceedings, as well as to exhort
      with regard to the future, that Plato transmits to Sicily his long
      seventh and eighth Epistles, wherein are embodied his objections
      against the usefulness of written exposition intended for readers
      generally. </p>

        The Platonic dialogue was in this respect different from the
        Aristotelian dialogue. Aristotle, in his composed dialogues,
        introduced other speakers, but delivered the principal arguments
        in his own name. Cicero followed his example, in the De Finibus
        and elsewhere: &#8220;Qu&aelig; his temporibus scripsi, &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957;
        morem habent: in quo sermo ita inducitur c&aelig;terorum, ut
        penes ipsum sit principatus&#8221;. (Cic. ad Att. xiii. 19.)</p>
      <p>Herakleides of Pontus (Cicero, ibid.), in his composed
        dialogues, introduced himself as a &#954;&#969;&#966;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;. Plato does
        not even do thus much.</p>

        We see this from Epist. vii. 341 B, 344 D, 345 A. Plato speaks
        of the impression as then prevalent (when he wrote) in the mind
        of Dionysius:&#8212;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#916;&#953;&#959;&#957;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958; &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962; <span

        exposition assumed by Plato; the assumption intelligible in his
        day.</span></p>
    <p>These objections (which Plato had often insisted on,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_39" href="#Footnotev1_8_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
      and which are also, in part, urged by Sokrates in the
      Ph&aelig;drus) have considerable force, if we look to the way in
      which Plato conceives them. In the first place, Plato conceives
      the exposition as not merely written but published: as being,
      therefore, presented to all minds, the large majority being
      ignorant, unprepared, and beset with that false persuasion of
      knowledge which Sokrates regarded as universal. In so far as it
      comes before these latter, nothing is gained, and something is
      lost; for derision is brought upon the attempt to teach.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_40" href="#Footnotev1_8_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a>
      In the next place, there probably existed, at that time, no
      elementary work whatever for beginners in any science: the
      Elements of Geometry by Euclid were published more than a century
      after Plato&#8217;s death, at Alexandria. Now, when Plato says that
      written expositions, then scarcely known, would be useless to the
      student &#8212; he compares them with the continued presence and
      conversation of a competent teacher; whom he supposes not to rely
      upon direct exposition, but to talk much &#8220;about and about&#8221; the
      subject, addressing the pupil with a large variety of illustrative
      interrogations, adapting all that was said to his peculiar
      difficulties and rate of progress, and thus evoking the inherent
      cognitive force of the pupil&#8217;s own mind. That any Elements of
      Geometry (to say nothing of more complicated inquiries) could be
      written and published, such that an &#7936;&#947;&#949;&#969;&#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; might take up the
      work and learn geometry by means of it, without being misled by
      equivocal names, bad definitions, and diagrams exhibiting the
      definition as clothed with special accessories &#8212; this is a
      possibility which Plato contests, and which we cannot wonder at
      his contesting.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_41" href="#Footnotev1_8_41"><span

        Some just and pertinent remarks, bearing on this subject, are
        made by Condorcet, in one of his Academic &Eacute;loges: &#8220;Les
        livres ne peuvent remplacer les le&ccedil;ons des ma&icirc;tres
        habiles, lorsque les sciences n&#8217;ont pas encore fait assez de
        progr&egrave;s, pour que les v&eacute;rit&eacute;s, qui en
        forment l&#8217;ensemble, puissent &ecirc;tres distribu&eacute;es et
        rapproch&eacute;es entre elles suivant un ordre
        syst&eacute;matique: lorsque la m&eacute;thode d&#8217;en chercher de
        nouvelles n&#8217;a pas &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;duite &agrave; des
        proc&eacute;d&eacute;s exacts et simples, &agrave; des
        r&egrave;gles s&ucirc;res et pr&eacute;cises. Avant cette
        &eacute;poque, il faut &ecirc;tre d&eacute;j&agrave;
        consomm&eacute; dans une science pour lire avec utilit&eacute;
        les ouvrages qui en traitent: et comme cette esp&egrave;ce
        d&#8217;enfance de l&#8217;art est le temps o&ugrave; les
        pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s y regnent avec le plus d&#8217;empire,
        o&ugrave; les savants sont les plus expos&eacute;s &agrave; donner
        leurs hypoth&egrave;ses pour de v&eacute;ritables principes, on
        risquerait encore de s&#8217;&eacute;garer si l&#8217;on se bornait aux
        le&ccedil;ons d&#8217;un seul ma&icirc;tre, quand m&ecirc;me on aurait
        choisi celui que la renomm&eacute;e place au premier rang; car
        ce temps est aussi celui des reputations usurp&eacute;es. Les
        voyages sont donc alors le seul moyen de s&#8217;instruire, comme ils
        l&#8217;&eacute;taient dans l&#8217;antiquit&eacute; et avant la
        d&eacute;couverte de l&#8217;imprimerie.&#8221; (Condorcet, &Eacute;loge de

        efficacy of the expository process. &#8212; Power of sustaining a
        Sokratic cross-examination.</span></p>
    <p>Lastly, when we see by what standard Plato tests the efficacy of
      any expository process, we shall see yet more clearly how he came
      to consider written exposition unavailing. The standard which he
      applies is, that the learner shall be rendered able both to apply
      to others, and himself to endure from others, a Sokratic Elenchus
      or cross-examination as to the logical difficulties involved in
      all the steps and helps to learning. Unless he can put to others
      and follow up the detective questions &#8212; unless he can also answer
      them, when put to himself, pertinently and consistently, so as to
      avoid being brought to confusion or contradiction &#8212; Plato will not
      allow that he has attained true knowledge.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_42" href="#Footnotev1_8_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>

        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page359" id="v1page359"></a>359</span>as



      this, we must admit that no reading of written expositions will
      enable the student to acquire it. The impression made is too
      superficial, and the mind is too passive during such a process, to
      be equal to the task of meeting new points of view, and combating
      difficulties not expressly noticed in the treatise which has been
      studied. The only way of permanently arming and strengthening the
      mind, is (according to Plato) by long-continued oral interchange
      and stimulus, multiplied comment and discussion from different
      points of view, and active exercise in dialectic debate: not
      aiming at victory over an opponent, but reasoning out each
      question in all its aspects, affirmative and negative. It is only
      after a long course of such training &#8212; the living word of the
      competent teacher, applied to the mind of the pupil, and
      stimulating its productive and self-defensive force &#8212; that any
      such knowledge can be realised as will suffice for the exigencies
      of the Sokratic Elenchus.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_43"

        Plato, Epist. vii. 343 D. The difficulties which Plato had here
        in his eye, and which he required to be solved as conditions
        indispensable to real knowledge &#8212; are jumped over in geometrical
        and other scientific expositions, as belonging not to geometry,
        &amp;c., but to logic. M. Jouffroy remarks, in the Preface to
        his translation of Reid&#8217;s works (p. clxxiv.):&#8212;&#8220;Toute science
        particuli&egrave;re qui, au lieu de prendre pour
        accord&eacute;es les donn&eacute;es <i>&agrave; priori</i>
        qu&#8217;elle implique, discute l&#8217;autorit&eacute; de ces
        donn&eacute;es &#8212; ajoute &agrave; son objet propre celui de la
        logique, confond une autre mission avec la sienne, et par cela
        m&ecirc;me compromet la sienne: car nous verrons tout
        &agrave;-l&#8217;heure, et l&#8217;histoire de la philosophic montre,
        quelles difficult&eacute;s pr&eacute;sentent ces
        probl&egrave;mes qui sont l&#8217;objet propre de la logique; et nous
        demeurerons convaincus que, si les <i>diff&eacute;rentes
          sciences avaient eu la pr&eacute;tention de les
          &eacute;claircir avant de passer outre, toutes peut-&ecirc;tre
          en seraient encore &agrave; cette pr&eacute;face</i>, et

      </p>
      <p>Remarks of a similar bearing will be found in the second
        paragraph of Mr. John Stuart Mill&#8217;s Essay on Utilitarianism. It
        has been found convenient to distinguish the logic of a science
        from the expository march of the same science. But Plato would
        not have acknowledged &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, except as including both. Hence
        his view about the uselessness of written expository treatises.
      </p>
      <p>Aristotle, in a remarkable passage of the Metaphysica (&#915;. p.
        1005, a. 20 seqq.) takes pains to distinguish the Logic of
        Mathematics from Mathematics themselves &#8212; as a separate province
        and matter of study. He claims the former as belonging to
        Philosophia Prima or Ontology. Those principles which
        mathematicians called Axioms were not peculiar to Mathematics
        (he says), but were affirmations respecting Ens quatenus Ens:
        the mathematician was entitled to assume them so far as
        concerned his own department, and his students must take them
        for granted: but if he attempted to explain or appreciate them
        in their full bearing, he overstepped his proper limits, through
        want of proper schooling in Analytica (&#8005;&#963;&#945; &#948;&#8217; &#7952;&#947;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

        &#7936;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#961;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#957;&middot; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;

        1005, b. 2.) We see from the words of Aristotle that many
        mathematical enquirers of his time did not recognise (any more
        than Plato recognised) the distinction upon which he here
        insists: we see also that the term <i>Axioms</i> had become a
        technical one for the <i>principia</i> of mathematical
        demonstration (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#7936;&#958;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#8212;
        p. 1005, a. 20); I do not concur in Sir William Hamilton&#8217;s
        doubts on this point. (Dissertations on Reid&#8217;s Works, note A. p.
        764.) </p>
      <p>The distinction which Aristotle thus brings to notice,
        seemingly for the first time, is one of considerable importance.</p>

        This is forcibly put by Plato, Epistol. vii. 344 B. Compare
        Plato, Republic, vi. 499 A. Ph&aelig;drus, 276 A-E. &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;

      <p>Though Plato, in the Ph&aelig;drus, declares oral teaching to
        be the only effectual way of producing a permanent and
        deep-seated effect &#8212; as contrasted with the more superficial
        effect produced by reading a written exposition: yet even oral
        teaching, when addressed in the form of continuous lecture or
        sermon (&#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#967;&#8134;&#962;, Ph&aelig;drus, 277 E; &#964;&#8056;

        elsewhere as of little effect. To produce any permanent result,
        you must diversify the point of view &#8212; you must test by
        circumlocutory interrogation &#8212; you must begin by dispelling
        established errors, &amp;c. See the careful explanation of the
        passage in the Ph&aelig;drus (277 E), given by Ueberweg,
        Aechtheit der Platon. Schrift. pp. 16-22. Direct teaching, in
        many of the Platonic dialogues, is not counted as capable of
        producing serious improvement. </p>
      <p>When we come to the Menon and the Ph&aelig;don, we shall hear

      in his own name and with his own responsibility attached to the

      Probably he may himself have destroyed them, as he exhorts
      Dionysius to destroy the Epistle which we now read as second,
      after reading it over frequently. And we may doubt whether he was
      not displeased with Aristotle and Hesti&aelig;us<a

        Themistius mentions it as a fact recorded (I wish he had told us

        philosophical opinions in his own name; but he may have
        published them in the dialogues under the name of others.</span></p>
    <p>That Plato would never consent to write for the public in his own
      name, must be taken as a fact in his character; probably arising
      from early caution produced by the fate of Sokrates, combined with
      preference for the Sokratic mode of handling. But to what extent
      he really kept back his opinions from the public, or whether he
      kept them back at all, by design &#8212; I do not undertake to say. The
      borrowed names under which he wrote, and the veil of dramatic
      fiction, gave him greater freedom as to the thoughts enunciated,
      and were adopted for the express purpose of acquiring greater
      freedom. How far the lectures which he delivered to his own
      special auditory differed from the opinions made known in his
      dialogues to the general reader, or how far his conversation with
      a few advanced pupils differed from both &#8212; are questions which we
      have no sufficient means of answering. There probably was a
      considerable difference. Aristotle alludes to various doctrines of
      Plato which we cannot find in the Platonic writings: but these
      doctrines are not such as could have given peculiar offence, if
      published; they are, rather abstruse and hard to understand. It
      may also be true (as Tennemann says) that Plato had two distinct
      modes of handling philosophy <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page361" id="v1page361"></a>361</span>&#8212; a popular and
      a scientific: but it cannot be true (as the same learned author<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_45" href="#Footnotev1_8_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
      asserts) that his published dialogues contained the popular and
      not the scientific. No one surely can regard the Tim&aelig;us,
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, Phil&ecirc;bus, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
      Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, &amp;c., as works in which dark or
      difficult questions are kept out of sight for the purpose of
      attracting the ordinary reader. Among the dialogues themselves (as
      I have before remarked) there exist the widest differences; some
      highly popular and attractive, others altogether the reverse, and
      many gradations between the two. Though I do not doubt therefore
      that Plato produced powerful effect both as lecturer to a special
      audience, and as talker with chosen students &#8212; yet in what respect
      such lectures and conversation differed from what we read in his
      dialogues, I do not feel that we have any means of knowing. </p>

        This portion of Tennemann&#8217;s History is valuable, as it takes due
        account of the seventh Platonic Epistle, compared with the
        remarkable passage in the Ph&aelig;drus about the inefficacy of
        written exposition for the purpose of teaching.</p>
      <p>But I cannot think that Tennemann rightly interprets the
        Epistol. vii. I see no proof that Plato had any secret or
        esoteric philosophy, reserved for a few chosen pupils, and not
        proclaimed to the public from apprehension of giving offence to
        established creeds: though I believe such apprehension to have
        operated as one motive, deterring him from publishing any

    <p>In judging of Plato, we must confine ourselves to the evidence
      furnished by one or more of the existing Platonic compositions,
      adding the testimony of Aristotle and a few others respecting
      Platonic views not declared in the dialogues. Though little can be

        defective, but still useful &#8212; Dialogues of Search, Dialogues of
        Exposition.</span></p>
    <p>The scheme proposed by Thrasyllus, so far as intended to furnish
      a symmetrical arrangement of all the Platonic works, is defective,
      partly because the apportionment of the separate works between the
      two leading classes is in several cases erroneous &#8212; partly because
      the discrimination of the two leading classes, as well as the
      sub-division of one of the two, is founded on diversity of Method,
      while the sub-division of the other class is founded on diversity
      of Subject. But the scheme is nevertheless useful, as directing
      our attention to real and important <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page362" id="v1page362"></a>362</span>attributes
      belonging in common to considerable groups of dialogues. It is in
      this respect preferable to the fanciful dramatic partnership of
      trilogies and tetralogies, as well as to the mystical
      interpretation and arrangement suggested by the Neo-platonists.
      The Dialogues of Exposition &#8212; in which one who knows (or professes
      to know) some truth, announces and developes it to those who do
      not know it &#8212; are contrasted with those of Search or
      Investigation, in which the element of knowledge and affirmative
      communication is wanting. All the interlocutors are at once
      ignorant and eager to know; all of them are jointly engaged in
      searching for the unknown, though one among them stands prominent
      both in suggesting where to look and in testing all that is found,
      whether it be really the thing looked for. Among the expository
      dialogues, the most marked specimens are Tim&aelig;us and
      Epinomis, in neither of which is there any searching or testing
      debate at all. Republic, Ph&aelig;don, Phil&ecirc;bus, exhibit
      exposition preceded or accompanied by a search. Of the dialogues
      of pure investigation, the most elaborate specimen is the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus: Menon, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s,
      Lysis, Euthyphron, &amp;c., are of the like description, yet less
      worked out. There are also several others. In the Menon, indeed,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_46" href="#Footnotev1_8_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
      Sokrates goes so far as to deny that there can be any real
      teaching, and to contend that what appears teaching is only
      resuscitation of buried or forgotten knowledge. </p>

        affirmative result. Dialogues of Search are wanting in that
        attribute.</span></p>
    <p>Of these two classes of Dialogues, the Expository are those which
      exhibit the distinct attribute &#8212; an affirmative result or
      doctrine, announced and developed by a person professing to know,
      and proved in a manner more or less satisfactory. The other class
      &#8212; the Searching or Investigative &#8212; have little else in common
      except the absence of this property. We find in them debate,
      refutation, several points of view canvassed and some shown to be
      untenable; but there is no affirmative result established, or even
      announced as established, at the close. Often there is even a
      confession of disappointment. In other respects, the dialogues of
      this class are greatly diversified among one another: they have
      only the one <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page363"

        with that of Aristotle &#8212; Dialectic, Demonstrative.</span></p>
    <p>Now the distribution made by Thrasyllus of the dialogues under
      two general heads (1. Dialogues of Search or Investigation, 2.
      Dialogues of Exposition) coincides, to a considerable extent, with
      the two distinct intellectual methods recognised by Aristotle as
      Dialectic and Demonstrative: Dialectic being handled by Aristotle
      in the Topica, and Demonstration in the Posterior Analytica.
      &#8220;Dialectic&#8221; (says Aristotle) &#8220;is tentative, respecting those
      matters of which philosophy aims at cognizance.&#8221; Accordingly,
      Dialectic (as well as Rhetoric) embraces all matters without
      exception, but in a tentative and searching way, recognising
      arguments <i>pro</i> as well as <i>con</i>, and bringing to view
      the antithesis between the two, without any preliminary assumption
      or predetermined direction, the questioner being bound to proceed
      only on the answers given by the respondent: while philosophy
      comes afterwards, dividing this large field into appropriate
      compartments, laying down authoritative <i>principia</i> in
      regard to each, and deducing from them, by logical process,
      various positive results.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_47"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> Plato
      does not use the term Dialectic exactly in the same sense as
      Aristotle. He implies by it two things: 1. That the process shall
      be colloquial, two or more minds engaged in a joint research, each
      of them animating and stimulating the others. 2. That the matter
      investigated shall be general &#8212; some general question or
      proposition: that the premisses shall all be general truths, and
      that the objects kept before the mind shall be Forms or Species,
      apart from particulars.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_48"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> Here it
      stands in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page364"
          id="v1page364"></a>364</span>contrast with Rhetoric, which
      aims at the determination of some particular case or debated
      course of conduct, judicial or political, and which is intended to
      end in some immediate practical verdict or vote. Dialectic, in
      Plato&#8217;s sense, comprises the whole process of philosophy. His
      Dialogues of Search correspond to Aristotle&#8217;s Dialectic, being
      machinery for generating arguments and for ensuring that every
      argument shall be subjected to the interrogation of an opponent:
      his Dialogues of Exposition, wherein some definite result is
      enunciated and proved (sufficiently or not), correspond to what
      Aristotle calls Demonstration. </p>

        details. He applies his own principles erroneously.</span></p>
    <p>If now we take the main scheme of distributing the Platonic
      Dialogues, proposed by Thrasyllus &#8212; 1. Dialogues of Exposition,
      with an affirmative result; 2. Dialogues of Investigation or
      Search, without an affirmative result &#8212; and if we compare the
      number of Dialogues (out of the thirty-six in all), which he
      specifies as belonging to each &#8212; we shall find twenty-two
      specified under the former head, and fourteen under the latter.
      Moreover, among the twenty-two are ranked Republic and Leges: each
      of them greatly exceeding in bulk any other composition of Plato.
      It would appear thus that there is a preponderance both in number
      and bulk on the side of the Expository. But when we analyse the
      lists of Thrasyllus, we see that he has unduly enlarged that side
      of the account, and unduly contracted the other. He has enrolled
      among the Expository &#8212; 1. The Apology, the Epistol&aelig;, and the
      Menexenus, which ought not properly to be ranked under either
      head. 2. The The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Parmenid&ecirc;s, Hipparchus,
      Erast&aelig;, Minos, Kleitophon &#8212; every one of which ought to be
      transferred to the other head. 3. The Ph&aelig;drus, Symposion,
      and Kratylus, which are admissible by indulgence, since they do
      indeed present affirmative exposition, but in small proportion
      compared to the negative criticism, the rhetorical and poetical
      ornament: they belong in fact to both classes, but more
      preponderantly to one. 4. The Republic. This he includes with
      perfect justice, for the eight last books of it are expository.
      Yet the first book exhibits to us a specimen of negative and
      refutative dialectic which is not surpassed by anything <span

      Plato. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Thrasyllus has placed among the Dialogues of
      Search one which might, with equal or greater propriety, be ranked
      among the Expository &#8212; the Protagoras. It is true that this
      dialogue involves much of negation, refutation, and dramatic
      ornament: and that the question propounded in the beginning
      (Whether virtue be teachable?) is not terminated. But there are
      two portions of the dialogue which are, both of them, decided
      specimens of affirmative exposition &#8212; the speech of Protagoras in
      the earlier part (wherein the growth of virtue, without special
      teaching or professional masters, is elucidated) &#8212; and the
      argument of Sokrates at the close, wherein the identity of the
      Good and the Pleasurable is established.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_49"

        We may remark that Thrasyllus, though he enrols the Protagoras
        under the class Investigative, and the sub-class Agonistic,
        places it alone in a still lower class which he calls
        &#7960;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;. Now, if we turn to the Platonic dialogue
        Euthyd&ecirc;mus, p. 278 D, we shall see that Plato uses the
        words &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#958;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; and &#8017;&#966;&#951;&#947;&#942;&#963;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; as exact equivalents: so that
        &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; would have the same meaning as &#8017;&#966;&#951;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;.</p>

        of the searching and testing dialogues over the expository and
        dogmatical.</span></p>
    <p>It will thus appear, from a fair estimate and comparison of
      lists, that the relation which Plato bears to philosophy is more
      that of a searcher, tester, and impugner, than that of an
      expositor and dogmatist &#8212; though he undertakes both the two
      functions: more negative than affirmative &#8212; more ingenious in
      pointing out difficulties, than successful in solving them. I must
      again repeat that though this classification is just, as far as it
      goes, and the best which can be applied to the dialogues, taken as
      a whole &#8212; yet the dialogues have much which will not enter into
      the classification, and each has its own peculiarities. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_28"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_28"></a>Dialogues of Search &#8212; sub-classes
        among them recognised by Thrasyllus &#8212; Gymnastic and Agonistic,
        &amp;c.</span></p>
    <p>The Dialogues of Search, thus comprising more than half the
      Platonic compositions, are again distributed by Thrasyllus into
      two sub-classes &#8212; Gymnastic and Agonistic: the Gymnastic, again,
      into Obstetric and Peirastic; the Agonistic, into Probative and
      Refutative. Here, again, there is a pretence of symmetrical
      arrangement, which will not hold good if we examine it closely.
      Nevertheless, the epithets point to real attributes of various
      dialogues, and deserve the more attention, inasmuch as they imply
      a view of philosophy foreign to the prevalent way of looking at
      it. Obstetric and Tentative or Testing (Peirastic) are epithets
      which a reader may understand; but he will not easily see how they
      bear upon the process of philosophy. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_29"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_29"></a>Philosophy, as now understood,
        includes authoritative teaching, positive results, direct
        proofs.</span></p>
    <p>The term <i>philosopher</i> is generally understood to mean
      something else. In appreciating a philosopher, it is usual to ask,
      What authoritative creed has he proclaimed, for disciples to swear
      allegiance to? What positive system, or positive truths previously
      unknown or unproved, has he established? Next, by what arguments
      has he enforced or made them good? This is the ordinary proceeding
      of an historian of philosophy, as he calls up the roll of
      successive names. The philosopher is assumed to speak as one
      having authority; to have already made up his mind; and to be
      prepared to explain what his mind is. Readers require positive
      results announced, and positive evidence set before them, in a
      clear and straightforward manner. They are intolerant of all that
      is prolix, circuitous, not essential to the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page367" id="v1page367"></a>367</span>proof of the
      thesis in hand. Above all, an affirmative result is indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>When I come to the Tim&aelig;us, and Republic, &amp;c., I shall
      consider what reply Plato could make to these questions. In the
      meantime, I may observe that if philosophers are to be estimated
      by such a scale, he will not stand high on the list. Even in his
      expository dialogues, he cares little about clear proclamation of
      results, and still less about the shortest, straightest, and most
      certain road for attaining them. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_30"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_30"></a>The Platonic Dialogues of Search
        disclaim authority and teaching &#8212; assume truth to be unknown to
        all alike &#8212; follow a process devious as well as fruitless.</span></p>
    <p>But as to those numerous dialogues which are not expository,
      Plato could make no reply to the questions at all. There are no
      affirmative results:&#8212;and there is a process of enquiry, not only
      fruitless, but devious, circuitous, and intentionally protracted.
      The authoritative character of a philosopher is disclaimed. Not
      only Plato never delivers sentence in his own name, but his
      principal spokesman, far from speaking with authority, declares
      that he has not made up his own mind, and that he is only a
      searcher along with others, more eager in the chase than they are.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_50" href="#Footnotev1_8_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
      Philosophy is conceived as the search for truth still unknown; not
      as an explanation of truth by one who knows it, to others who do
      not know it. The process of search is considered as being in
      itself profitable and invigorating, even though what is sought be
      not found. The ingenuity of Sokrates is shown, not by what he
      himself produces, for he avows himself altogether barren &#8212; but by
      his obstetric aid: that is, by his being able to evolve, from a
      youthful mind, answers of which it is pregnant, and to test the
      soundness and trustworthiness of those answers when delivered: by
      his power, besides, of exposing or refuting unsound answers, and
      of convincing others of the fallacy of that which they confidently
      believed themselves to know. </p>

        In addition to the declarations of Sokrates to this effect in
        the Platonic Apology (pp. 21-23), we read the like in many
        Platonic dialogues. Gorgias, 506 A. &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#964;&#959;&#953; &#7956;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;

        even in the Republic, in many parts of which there is much
        dogmatism and affirmation: v. p. 450 E. &#7936;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#945;&#8054;

      is the main idea which Plato inherited from Sokrates, and worked
      out in more than one half of his dialogues. It is under this
      general head that the subdivisions of Thrasyllus fall &#8212; the
      Obstetric, the Testing or Verifying, the Refutative. The process
      is one in which both the two concurrent minds are active, but each
      with an inherent activity peculiar to itself. The questioner does
      not follow a predetermined course of his own, but proceeds
      altogether on the answer given to him. He himself furnishes only
      an indispensable stimulus to the parturition of something with
      which the respondent is already pregnant, and applies testing
      questions to that which he hears, until the respondent is himself
      satisfied that the answer will not hold. Throughout all this,
      there is a constant appeal to the free, self-determining judgment
      of the respondent&#8217;s own mind, combined with a stimulus exciting
      the intellectual productiveness of that mind to the uttermost. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_32"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_32"></a>Relation of teacher and learner.
        Appeal to authority is suppressed.</span></p>
    <p>What chiefly deserves attention here, as a peculiar phase in the
      history of philosophy, is, that the relation of teacher and
      learner is altogether suppressed. Sokrates not only himself
      disclaims the province and title of a teacher, but treats with
      contemptuous banter those who assume it. Now &#8220;the learner&#8221; (to use
      a memorable phrase of Aristotle<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_51"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>) &#8220;is
      under obligation to believe&#8221;: he must be a passive recipient of
      that which is communicated to him by the teacher. The relation
      between the two is that of authority on the one side, and of
      belief generated by authority on the other. But Sokrates requires
      from no man implicit trust: nay he deprecates it as dangerous.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_52" href="#Footnotev1_8_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
      It is one peculiarity in these Sokratic dialogues, that the
      sentiment of authority, instead of being invoked and worked up, as
      is generally done in philosophy, is formally disavowed and
      practically set aside. &#8220;I have not made up my mind: I am not
      prepared to swear allegiance to any creed: I give you the reasons
      for and against each: you must decide for yourself.&#8221;<a

        The sentiment of the Academic sect &#8212; descending from Sokrates
        and Plato, not through Xenokrates and Polemon, but through
        Arkesilaus and Karneades &#8212; illustrates the same elimination of
        the idea of authority. &#8220;Why are you so curious to know what <i>I

    <p>This process &#8212; the search for truth as an unknown &#8212; is in the
      modern world put out of sight. All discussion is conducted by
      persons who profess to have found it or learnt it, and to be in
      condition to proclaim it to others. Even the philosophical works
      of Cicero are usually pleadings by two antagonists, each of whom
      professes to know the truth, though Cicero does not decide between
      them: and in this respect they differ from the groping and
      fumbling of the Platonic dialogues. Of course the search for truth
      must go on in modern times, as it did in ancient: but it goes on
      silently and without notice. The most satisfactory theories have
      been preceded by many infructuous guesses and tentatives. The
      theorist may try many different hypotheses (we are told that
      Kepler tried nineteen) which he is forced successively to reject;
      and he may perhaps end without finding any better. But all these
      tentatives, verifying tests, doubts, and rejections, are confined
      to his own bosom or his own study. He looks back upon them without
      interest, sometimes even with disgust; least of all does he seek
      to describe them in detail as objects of interest to others. They
      are probably known to none but himself: for it <span

      not occur to him to follow the Platonic scheme of taking another
      mind into partnership, and entering upon that distribution of
      active intellectual work which we read in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. There are cases in which two chemists have
      carried on joint researches, under many failures and
      disappointments, perhaps at last without success. If a record were
      preserved of their parley during the investigation, the grounds
      for testing and rejecting one conjecture, and for selecting what
      should be tried after it &#8212; this would be in many points a parallel
      to the Platonic process. </p>

        name="FnAnchorv1_8_54" href="#Footnotev1_8_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
      Of this Dialectic, the real Sokrates was the greatest master that
      Athens ever saw: he could deal as he chose (says Xenophon<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_55" href="#Footnotev1_8_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>)
      with all disputants: he turned them round his finger. In this
      process, one person set up a thesis, and the other cross-examined
      him upon it: the most irresistible of all cross-examiners was the
      real Sokrates. The nine books of Aristotle&#8217;s Topica (including the
      book De Sophisticis Elenchis) are composed with the object of
      furnishing suggestions, and indicating rules, both to the
      cross-examiner and to the respondent, in such Dialectic debates.
      Plato does not lay down any rules: but he has given us, in his
      dialogues of search, specimens of dialectic procedure shaped in
      his own fashion. Several of his contemporaries, companions of <span

        The habit of supposing a general question to be undecided, and
        of having it argued by competent advocates before auditors who
        have not made up their minds &#8212; is now so disused (everywhere
        except in a court of law), that one reads with surprise Galen&#8217;s
        declaration that the different competing medical theories were
        so discussed in his day. His master Pelops maintained a

        The dialogues composed by Aristotle himself were in great
        measure dialogues of search, exercises of argumentation <i>pro</i>
        and <i>con</i> (Cicero, De Finib. v. 4). &#8220;Aristoteles, ut
        solet, qu&aelig;rendi grati&acirc;, qu&aelig;dam subtilitatis
        su&aelig; argumenta excogitavit in Gryllo,&#8221; &amp;c. (Quintilian,
        Inst. Orat. ii. 17.) </p>
      <p>Bernays indicates the probable titles of many among the lost
        Aristotelian Dialogues (Die Dialoge des Aristoteles, pp. 132,
        133, Berlin, 1868), and gives in his book many general remarks
        upon them. </p>
      <p>The observations of Aristotle in the Metaphys. (A. &#7952;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#969;&#957; 993,
        b. 1-16) are conceived in a large and just spirit. He says that
        among all the searchers for truth, none completely succeed, and
        none completely fail: those, from whose conclusions we dissent,
        do us service by exercising our intelligence &#8212; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7957;&#958;&#953;&#957;

        book B of the Metaphysica is a continuation of the same views.
        Compare Scholia, p. 604, b. 29, Brandis.</p>

    <p>Such compositions give something like fair play to the negative
      arm of philosophy; in the employment of which the Eleate Zeno
      first became celebrated, and the real Sokrates yet more
      celebrated. This negative arm is no less essential than the
      affirmative, to the validity of a body of reasoned truth, such as
      philosophy aspires to be. To know how to disprove is quite as
      important as to know how to prove: the one is co-ordinate and
      complementary to the other. And the man who disproves what is
      false, or guards mankind against assenting to it,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_57" href="#Footnotev1_8_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>
      renders a service to philosophy, even though he may not be able to
      render the ulterior service of proving any truth in its place. </p>

        The Stoics had full conviction of this. In Cicero&#8217;s summary of
        the Stoic doctrine (De Finibus, iii. 21, 72) we read:&#8212;&#8220;Ad easque

        (Stoici) et Physicam: easque ambas virtutum nomine appellant:

    <p>By historians of ancient philosophy, negative procedure is
      generally considered as represented by the Sophists and the
      Megarici, and is the main ground for those harsh epithets which
      are commonly applied to both of them. The negative (they think)
      can only be tolerated in small doses, and even then merely as
      ancillary to the affirmative. That is, if you have an affirmative
      theory to propose, you are allowed to urge such objections as you
      think applicable against rival theories, but only in order to make
      room for your own. It seems to be assumed as requiring no proof
      that the confession of ignorance is an intolerable condition;
      which every man ought to be ashamed of in himself, and which no
      man is justified in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page372"
          id="v1page372"></a>372</span>inflicting on any one else. If
      you deprive the reader of one affirmative solution, you are
      required to furnish him with another which you are prepared to
      guarantee as the true one. &#8220;Le Roi est mort &#8212; Vive le Roi&#8221;: the
      throne must never be vacant. It is plain that under such a
      restricted application, the full force of the negative case is
      never brought out. The pleadings are left in the hands of counsel,
      each of whom takes up only such fragments of the negative case as
      suit the interests of his client, and suppresses or slurs over all
      such other fragments of it as make against his client. But to
      every theory (especially on the topics discussed by Sokrates and
      Plato) there are more or less of objections applicable &#8212; even the
      best theory being true only on the balance. And if the purpose be
      to ensure a complete body of reasoned truth, all these objections
      ought to be faithfully exhibited, by one who stands forward as
      their express advocate, without being previously retained for any
      separate or inconsistent purpose.</p>

        the negative procedure: absolute necessity of it as a condition

    <p>How much Plato himself, in his dialogues of search, felt his own
      vocation as champion of the negative procedure, we see marked
      conspicuously in the dialogue called Parmenid&ecirc;s. This
      dialogue is throughout a protest against forward affirmation, and
      an assertion of independent <i>locus standi</i> for the
      negationist and objector. The claims of the latter must first be
      satisfied, before the affirmant can be considered as solvent. The
      advocacy of those claims is here confided to veteran Parmenides,
      who sums them up in a formidable total: Sokrates being opposed to
      him under the unusual disguise of a youthful and forward
      affirmant. Parmenides makes no pretence of advancing any rival
      doctrine. The theories which he selects for criticism are the
      Platonic theory of intelligible Concepts, and his own theory of
      the Unum: he indicates how many objections must be removed &#8212; how
      many contradictions must be solved &#8212; how many opposite hypotheses
      must be followed out to their results &#8212; before either of these
      theories can be affirmed with assurance. The exigencies enumerated

      inseparable from the process of searching for truth, and unless a

        That the only road to trustworthy affirmation lies through a
        string of negations, unfolded and appreciated by systematic
        procedure, is strongly insisted on by Bacon, Novum Organum, ii.
        15, &#8220;Omnino Deo (formarum inditori et opifici), aut fortasse
        angelis et intelligentiis competit formas per affirmationem
        immediate nosse, atque ab initio contemplationis. Sed certe
        supra hominem est: cui tantum conceditur, procedere primo per
        negativas, et postremo loco desinere in affirmativas, post
        omnimodam exclusionem.&#8221; Compare another Aphorism, i. 46. </p>
      <p>The following passage, transcribed from the Lectures of a
        distinguished physical philosopher of the present day, is
        conceived in the spirit of the Platonic Dialogues of Search,
        though Plato would have been astonished at such patient
        multiplication of experiments:&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;I should hardly sustain your interest in stating the
        difficulties which at first beset the investigation conducted
        with this apparatus, or the numberless precautions which the
        exact balancing of the two powerful sources of heat, here
        resorted to, rendered necessary. I believe the experiments, made
        with atmospheric air alone, might be numbered by tens of
        thousands. Sometimes for a week, or even for a fortnight,
        coincident and satisfactory results would be obtained: the
        strict conditions of accurate experimenting would appear to be
        found, when an additional day&#8217;s experience would destroy this
        hope and necessitate a recommencement, under changed conditions,
        of the whole inquiry. It is this which daunts the experimenter.
        It is this preliminary fight with the entanglements of a subject
        so dark, so doubtful, so uncheering, without any knowledge
        whether the conflict is to lead to anything worth possessing,
        that renders discovery difficult and rare. But the experimenter,
        and particularly the <i>young</i> experimenter, ought to know
        that as regards his own moral manhood, he cannot but win, if he
        only contend aright. <i>Even, with a negative result, his
          consciousness that he has gone fairly to the bottom of his
          subject, as far as his means allowed</i> &#8212; the feeling that he
        has not shunned labour, <i>though that labour may have resulted
          in laying bare the nakedness of his case</i> &#8212; re-acts upon
        his own mind, and gives it firmness for future work.&#8221; (Tyndall,
        Lectures on Heat, considered as a Mode of Motion, Lect x. p.

        procedure to be valuable by itself, and separately. His theory

        persuasion of knowledge.</span></p>
    <p>It will thus appear that among the conditions requisite for
      philosophy, both Sokrates and Plato regarded the negative
      procedure as co-ordinate in value with the affirmative, and
      indispensable as a preliminary stage. But Sokrates went a step
      farther. He assigned to the negative an intrinsic importance by
      itself, apart from all implication with the affirmative; and he
      rested that opinion upon a psychological ground, formally avowed,
      and far larger than anything laid down by the Sophists. He thought
      that the natural state of the human mind, among established
      communities, was not simply ignorance, but ignorance mistaking
      itself for knowledge &#8212; false or uncertified <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page374" id="v1page374"></a>374</span>belief &#8212; false
      persuasion of knowledge. The only way of dissipating such false
      persuasion was, the effective stimulus of the negative test, or
      cross-examining Elenchus; whereby a state of non-belief, or
      painful consciousness of ignorance, was substituted in its place.
      Such second state was indeed not the best attainable. It ought to
      be preliminary to a third, acquired by the struggles of the mind
      to escape from such painful consciousness; and to rise, under the
      continued stimulus of the tutelary Elenchus, to improved
      affirmative and defensible beliefs. But even if this third state
      were never reached, Sokrates declared the second state to be a
      material amendment on the first, which he deprecated as alike
      pernicious and disgraceful. </p>

        persuasion of knowledge.</span></p>
    <p>The psychological conviction here described stands proclaimed by
      Sokrates himself, with remarkable earnestness and emphasis, in his
      Apology before the Dikasts, only a month before his death. So
      deeply did he take to heart the prevalent false persuasion of
      knowledge, alike universal among all classes, mischievous, and
      difficult to correct &#8212; that he declared himself to have made war
      against it throughout his life, under a mission imposed upon him
      by the Delphian God; and to have incurred thereby wide-spread
      hatred among his fellow-citizens. To convict men, by
      cross-examination, of ignorance in respect to those matters which
      each man believed himself to know well and familiarly &#8212; this was
      the constant employment and the mission of Sokrates: not to teach
      &#8212; for he disclaimed the capacity of teaching &#8212; but to make men
      feel their own ignorance instead of believing themselves to know.
      Such cross-examination, conducted usually before an audience,
      however it might be salutary and indispensable, was intended to
      humiliate the respondent, and could hardly fail to offend and
      exasperate him. No one felt satisfaction except some youthful
      auditors, who admired the acuteness with which it was conducted.
      &#8220;I (declared Sokrates) am distinguished from others, and superior
      to others, by this character only &#8212; that I am conscious of my own
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page375" id="v1page375"></a>375</span>

        Sokrates and the Dikasts.</span></p>
    <p>In delivering this emphatic declaration, Sokrates himself
      intimates his apprehension that the Dikasts will treat his
      discourse as mockery; that they will not believe him to be in
      earnest: that they will scarcely have patience to hear him claim a
      divine mission for so strange a purpose.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_61"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> The
      declaration is indeed singular, and probably many of the Dikasts
      did so regard it; while those who thought it serious, heard it
      with repugnance. The separate value of the negative procedure or
      Elenchus was never before so unequivocally asserted, or so highly
      estimated. To disabuse men of those false beliefs which they
      mistook for knowledge, and to force on them the painful
      consciousness that they knew nothing &#8212; was extolled as the
      greatest service which could be rendered to them, and as rescuing
      them from a degraded and slavish state of mind.<a

        Aristotle, in the first book of Metaphysica (982, b. 17), when
        repeating a statement made in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus of Plato
        (155 D), that wonder is the beginning, or point of departure, of
        philosophy &#8212; explains the phrase by saying, that wonder is
        accompanied by a painful conviction of ignorance and sense of
        embarrassment. &#8001; &#948;&#8050; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#7988;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7936;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957; ... &#948;&#953;&#8048;

    <p>To understand the full purpose of Plato&#8217;s dialogues of search &#8212;
      testing, exercising, refuting, but not finding or providing &#8212; we
      must keep in mind the Sokratic Apology. Whoever, after reading the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, Lysis,
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, &amp;c., is tempted to exclaim &#8220;But, after all,
      Plato <i>must</i> have had in his mind some ulterior doctrine of
      conviction which he wished to impress, but which he has not
      clearly intimated,&#8221; will see, by the Sokratic Apology, that such a
      presumption is noway justifiable. Plato is a searcher, and has not
      yet made up his own mind: this is what he himself tells us, and
      what I literally believe, though few or none of his critics will
      admit it. His purpose in the dialogues of search, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page376" id="v1page376"></a>376</span>is



      plainly and sufficiently enunciated in the words addressed by
      Sokrates to The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; &#8220;Answer without being daunted:
      for if we prosecute our search, one of two alternatives is certain
      &#8212; either we shall find what we are looking for, or we shall get
      clear of the persuasion that we know what in reality we do not yet
      know. Now a recompense like this will leave no room for

        his Platonische Studien, pp. 8, 9, 74, 76, &amp;c.) is one of
        the few critics who deprecate the confidence and boldness with
        which recent scholars have ascribed to Plato affirmative
        opinions and systematic purpose which he does not directly
        announce. Bonitz vindicates the separate value and separate <i>locus



          standi</i> of the negative process in Plato&#8217;s estimation,
        particularly in the example of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus.
        Susemihl, in the preface to his second part, has controverted
        these views of Bonitz &#8212; in my judgment without any success. </p>
      <p>The following observations of recent French scholars are just,
        though they imply too much the assumption that there is always
        some affirmative jewel wrapped up in Plato&#8217;s complicated folds.
        M. Egger observes (Histoire de la Critique chez les Grecs,
        Paris, 1849, p. 84, ch. ii. sect. 4): </p>
      <p>&#8220;La philosophie de Platon n&#8217;offre pas, en
        g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, un ensemble de parties tr&egrave;s
        rigoureusement li&eacute;es entre elles. D&#8217;abord, il ne l&#8217;expose
        que sous forme dialogu&eacute;e: et dans ses dialogues,
        o&ugrave; il ne prend jamais de r&ocirc;le personnel, on ne voit
        pas clairement auquel des interlocuteurs il a confi&eacute; la
        d&eacute;fense de ses propres opinions. Parmi ces
        interlocuteurs, Socrate lui-m&ecirc;me, le plus naturel et le
        plus ordinaire interpr&egrave;te de la pens&eacute;e de son
        disciple, use fort souvent des libert&eacute;s de cette forme
        toute dramatique, pour se jouer dans les distinctions subtiles,
        pour exag&eacute;rer certains arguments, pour couper court
        &agrave; une discussion embarrassante, au moyen de quelque
        plaisanterie, et pour se retirer d&#8217;un d&eacute;bat sans
        conclure; en un mot, il a &#8212; ou, ce qui est plus vrai, Platon a,
        sous son nom &#8212; <i>des opinions de circonstance et des ruses de
          dialectique</i>, &agrave; travers lesquelles il est souvent
        difficile de retrouver le fond s&eacute;rieux de sa doctrine.
        Heureusement ces difficult&eacute;s ne touchent pas aux
        principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux du Platonisme. La critique
        Platonicienne en particulier dans ce qu&#8217;elle a de plus original,
        et de plus &eacute;lev&eacute;, se rattache &agrave; la grande
        th&eacute;orie des <i>id&eacute;es</i> et de la <i>r&eacute;miniscence</i>.
        On la retrouve expos&eacute;e dans plusieurs dialogues avec une
        clart&eacute; qui ne permet ni le doute ni l&#8217;incertitude.&#8221; </p>
      <p>I may also cite the following remarks made by M. Vacherot
        (Histoire Critique de l&#8217;&Eacute;cole d&#8217;Alexandrie, vol. ii. p.
        1, Pt. ii. Bk. ii. ch. i.) after his instructive analysis of the
        doctrines of Plotinus. I think the words are as much applicable
        to Plato as to Plotinus: the rather, as Plato never speaks in
        his own name, Plotinus always:&#8212;&#8220;Combien faut-il prendre garde
        d&#8217;ajouter &agrave; la pens&eacute;e du philosophe, et de lui
        pr&ecirc;ter un arrangement artificiel! Ce g&eacute;nie, plein
        d&#8217;enthousiasme et de fougue, n&#8217;a jamais connu ni mesure ni plan:
        jamais il ne s&#8217;est astreint &agrave; developper
        r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement une th&eacute;orie, ni &agrave;
        exposer avec suite un ensemble de th&eacute;ories, de
        mani&egrave;re &agrave; en former un syst&egrave;me. <i>Fort
          incertain dans sa marche, il prend, quitte, et reprend le
          m&ecirc;me sujet, sans jamais para&icirc;tre avoir dit son
          dernier mot</i>; toujours il r&eacute;pand de vives et
        abondantes clart&eacute;s sur les questions qu&#8217;il traite, mais
        rarement il les conduit &agrave; leur derni&egrave;re et
        d&eacute;finitive solution; sa rapide pens&eacute;e n&#8217;effleure
        pas seulement le sujet sur lequel elle passe, elle le
        p&eacute;n&eacute;tre et le creuse toujours, sans toutefois
        l&#8217;&eacute;puiser. Fort in&eacute;gal dans ses allures,
        tant&ocirc;t ce g&eacute;nie s&#8217;&eacute;chappe en inspirations
        rapides et tumultueuses, tant&ocirc;t il semble se tra&icirc;ner
        p&eacute;niblement, et se perdre dans un d&eacute;dale de
        subtiles abstractions, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

        reference to topics social, political, ethical.</span></p>
    <p>What those topics were, in respect to which Sokrates found this
      universal belief of knowledge, without the reality of knowledge &#8212;
      we know, not merely from the dialogues of Plato, but also from the
      Memorabilia of Xenophon. Sokrates did not touch upon recondite
      matters &#8212; upon the Kosmos, astronomy, meteorology. Such studies he
      discountenanced as useless, and even <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page377" id="v1page377"></a>377</span>as irreligious.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_64" href="#Footnotev1_8_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
      The subjects on which he interrogated were those of common,
      familiar, every-day talk: those which every one believed himself
      to know, and on which every one had a confident opinion to give:
      the respondent being surprised that any one could put the
      questions, or that there could be any doubt requiring solution.
      What is justice? what is injustice? what are temperance and
      courage? what is law, lawlessness, democracy, aristocracy? what is
      the government of mankind, and the attributes which qualify any
      one for exercising such government? Here were matters upon which
      every one talked familiarly, and would have been ashamed to be
      thought incapable of delivering an opinion. Yet it was upon these
      matters that Sokrates detected universal ignorance, coupled with a
      firm, but illusory, persuasion of knowledge. The conversation of
      Sokrates with Euthyd&ecirc;mus, in the Xenophontic Memorabilia<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_65" href="#Footnotev1_8_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
      &#8212; the first Alkibiad&ecirc;s, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s,
      Euthyphron, &amp;c., of Plato &#8212; are among the most marked
      specimens of such cross-examination or Elenchus &#8212; a string of
      questions, to which there are responses in indefinite number
      successively given, tested, and exposed as unsatisfactory. </p>

        Xenoph. Memor. iv. 2. A passage from Paley&#8217;s preface to his
        &#8220;Principles of Moral Philosophy,&#8221; illustrates well this Sokratic
        process: &#8220;Concerning the principle of morals, it would be
        premature to speak: but concerning the manner of unfolding and
        explaining that principle, I have somewhat which I wish to be
        remarked. An experience of nine years in the office of a public
        tutor in one of the Universities, and in that department of
        education to which these sections relate, afforded me frequent
        opportunity to observe, that in discoursing to young minds upon
        topics of morality, it <i>required much more pains to make them
          perceive the difficulty than to understand the solution</i>:
        that unless the subject was so drawn up to a point as to exhibit
        the full force of an objection, or the exact place of a doubt,
        before any explanation was entered upon &#8212; in other words, unless
        some curiosity was excited, before it was attempted to be
        satisfied &#8212; the teacher&#8217;s labour was lost. When information was
        not desired, it was seldom, I found, retained. I have made this
        observation my guide in the following work: that is, I have
        endeavoured, before I suffered myself to proceed in the
        disquisition, to put the reader in complete possession of the
        question: <i>and to do it in a way that I thought most likely
          to stir up his own doubts and solicitude about it</i>.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The answers which Sokrates elicited and exposed were simple <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page378" id="v1page378"></a>378</span>expressions



      of the ordinary prevalent belief upon matters on which each
      community possesses established dogmas, laws, customs, sentiments,
      fashions, points of view, &amp;c., belonging to itself. When
      Herodotus passed over to Egypt, he was astonished to find the
      judgment, feelings, institutions, and practices of the Egyptians,
      contrasting most forcibly with those of all other countries. He
      remarks the same (though less in degree) respecting Babylonians,
      Indians, Scythians, and others; and he is not less impressed with
      the veneration of each community for its own creed and habits,
      coupled with indifference or antipathy towards other creeds,
      disparate or discordant, prevailing elsewhere.<a

        The discordance between the various institutions established
        among the separate aggregations of mankind, often proceeding to
        the pitch of reciprocal antipathy &#8212; the imperative character of
        each in its own region, assuming the appearance of natural right
        and propriety &#8212; all this appears brought to view by the
        inquisitive and observant Herodotus, as well as by others
        (Xenophon, Cyrop&aelig;d. i. 3-18): but many new facts,
        illustrating the same thesis, were noticed by Aristotle and the
        Peripatetics, when a larger extent of the globe became opened to
        Hellenic survey. Compare Aristotle, Ethic. Nik. i. 3, 1094, b.
        15; Sextus Empiric. Pyrr. Hypotyp. i. sect 145-156, iii. sect
        198-234; and the remarkable extract from Bardesanes Syrus, cited
        by Eusebius, Pr&aelig;p. Evang. vi., and published in Orelli&#8217;s
        collection, pp. 202-219, Alexandri Aphrodis. et Aliorum De Fato,
        Zurich, 1824. </p>
      <p>Many interesting passages in illustration of the same thesis
        might be borrowed from Montaigne, Pascal, and others. But the
        most forcible of all illustrations are those furnished by the
        Oriental world, when surveyed or studied by intelligent
        Europeans, as it has been more fully during the last century.
        See especially Sir William Sleeman&#8217;s Rambles and Recollections
        of an Indian Official: two volumes which unfold with equal
        penetration and fidelity the manifestations of established
        sentiment among the Hindoos and Mahomedans. Vol. i. ch. iv.,
        describing a Suttee on the Nerbudda, is one of the most
        impressive chapters in the work: the rather as it describes the
        continuance of a hallowed custom, transmitted even from the days
        of Alexander. I transcribe also some valuable matter from an
        eminent living scholar, whose extensive erudition comprises
        Oriental as well as Hellenic philosophy. </p>
      <p>M. Barth&eacute;lemy St. Hilaire (Premier M&eacute;moire sur le
        S&acirc;nkhya, Paris, 1852, pp. 392-396) observes as follows
        respecting the Sanscrit system of philosophy called <i>S&acirc;nkhya</i>,
        the doctrine expounded and enforced by the philosopher Kapila &#8212;
        and respecting Buddha and Buddhism which was built upon the
        S&acirc;nkhya, amending or modifying it. Buddha is believed to
        have lived about 547 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Both the
        system of Buddha, and that of Kapila, are atheistic, as
        described by M. St. Hilaire. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Le second point o&ugrave; Bouddha se s&eacute;pare de Kapila
        concerne la doctrine. L&#8217;homme ne peut rester dans l&#8217;incertitude
        que Kapila lui laisse encore. L&#8217;&acirc;me
        d&eacute;livr&eacute;e, selon les doctrines de Kapila, peut
        toujours rena&icirc;tre. Il n&#8217;y a qu&#8217;un moyen, un seul moyen, de
        le sauver, &#8212; c&#8217;est de l&#8217;an&eacute;antir. Le n&eacute;ant seul
        est un s&ucirc;r asile: on ne revient pas de celui l&agrave;. &#8212;
        Bouddha lui promet le n&eacute;ant; et c&#8217;est avec cette promesse
        inouie qu&#8217;il a passionn&eacute; les hommes et converti les
        peuples. Que cette monstrueuse croyance, partag&eacute;e
        aujourd&#8217;hui par trois cents millions de sectateurs,
        r&eacute;volte en nous les instincts les plus &eacute;nergiques
        de notre nature &#8212; qu&#8217;elle soul&egrave;ve toutes les
        r&eacute;pugnances et toutes les horreurs de notre &acirc;me &#8212;
        qu&#8217;elle nous paraisse aussi incompr&eacute;hensible que hideuse
        &#8212; peu importe. Une partie consid&eacute;rable de
        l&#8217;humanit&eacute; l&#8217;a re&ccedil;ue, &#8212; pr&ecirc;te m&ecirc;me
        &agrave; la justifier par toutes les subtilit&eacute;s de la
        metaphysique la plus raffin&eacute;e, et &agrave; la confesser
        dans les tortures des plus affreux supplices et les
        aust&eacute;rit&eacute;s homicides d&#8217;un fanatisme aveugle. Si
        c&#8217;est une gloire que de dominer souverainement, &agrave; travers
        les &acirc;ges, la foi des hommes, &#8212; jamais fondateur de
        religion n&#8217;en eut une plus grande que le Bouddha: car aucun
        n&#8217;eut de pros&eacute;lytes plus fid&egrave;les ni plus nombreux.
        Mais je me trompe: le Bouddha ne pr&eacute;tendait jamais fonder
        une r&eacute;ligion. Il n&#8217;&eacute;tait que philosophe: et
        instruit dans toutes les sciences des Brahmans, il ne voulut
        personnellement que fonder, &agrave; leur exemple, un nouveau
        syst&egrave;me. Seulement, les moyens qu&#8217;il employait durent
        mener ses disciples plus loin qu&#8217;il ne comptait aller lui
        m&ecirc;me. En s&#8217;adressant &agrave; la foule, il faut
        bient&ocirc;t la discipliner et la r&eacute;gler. De l&agrave;,
        cette ordination r&eacute;ligieuse que le Bouddha donnait
        &agrave; ses adeptes, la hi&eacute;rarchie qu&#8217;il
        &eacute;tablissait entre eux, fond&eacute;e uniquement, comme la
        science l&#8217;exigeait, sur le m&eacute;rite divers des
        intelligences et des vertus &#8212; la douce et sainte morale qu&#8217;il
        pr&ecirc;chait, &#8212; le d&eacute;tachement de toutes choses en ce
        monde, si convenable &agrave; des asc&egrave;tes qui ne pensent
        qu&#8217;au salut &eacute;ternel &#8212; le v&#339;u de pauvret&eacute;, qui est
        la premi&egrave;re loi des Bouddhistes &#8212; et tout cet ensemble de
        dispositions qui constituent un gouvernement au lieu d&#8217;une
        &eacute;cole. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Mais ce n&#8217;est l&agrave; que l&#8217;ext&eacute;rieur du Bouddhisme:
        c&#8217;en est le d&eacute;veloppement mat&eacute;riel et
        n&eacute;cessaire. Au fond, son principe est celui du
        S&acirc;nkhya: seulement, il l&#8217;applique en grand. &#8212; C&#8217;est la
        science qui d&eacute;livre l&#8217;homme: et le Bouddha ajoute &#8212; Pour
        que l&#8217;homme soit d&eacute;livr&eacute; &agrave; jamais, il faut
        qu&#8217;il arrive au Nirv&acirc;na, c&#8217;est &agrave; dire, qu&#8217;il soit
        absolument an&eacute;anti. Le n&eacute;ant est donc le bout de
        la science: et le salut eternel, c&#8217;est l&#8217;an&eacute;antissement.&#8221;

      <p>The same line of argument is insisted on by M.
        Barth&eacute;lemy St. Hilaire in his other work &#8212; Bouddha et sa
        r&eacute;ligion, Paris, 1862, ed. 2nd: especially in his Chapter
        on the Nirv&acirc;na: wherein moreover he complains justly of
        the little notice which authors take of the established beliefs
        of those varieties of the human race which are found apart from

      to avoid, respecting the status and relations of each individual
      in the society, respecting even the admissible fashions of
      amusement and recreation &#8212; this is an established fact and
      condition of things, the real origin of which is for the most part
      unknown, but which each new member of the society is born to and
      finds subsisting. It is transmitted by tradition from parents to
      children, and is imbibed by the latter almost unconsciously from
      what they see and hear around, without any special season of
      teaching, or special persons to teach. It becomes a part of each
      person&#8217;s nature &#8212; a standing habit of mind, or fixed set of mental
      tendencies, according to which, particular experience is <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page380" id="v1page380"></a>380</span>

      It is not set forth in systematic proclamation, nor impugned, nor
      defended: it is enforced by a sanction of its own, the same real
      sanction or force in all countries, by fear of displeasure from
      the Gods, and by certainty of evil from neighbours and
      fellow-citizens. The community hate, despise, or deride, any
      individual member who proclaims his dissent from their social
      creed, or even openly calls it in question. Their hatred manifests
      itself in different ways at different times and occasions,
      sometimes by burning or excommunication, sometimes by banishment
      or interdiction<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_68" href="#Footnotev1_8_68"><span
          class="sp">68</span></a> from fire and water; at the very
      least, by exclusion from that amount of forbearance, good-will,
      and estimation, without which the life of an individual becomes
      insupportable: for society, though its power to make an individual
      happy is but limited, has complete power, easily exercised, to
      make him miserable. The orthodox public do not recognise in any
      individual citizen a right to scrutinise their creed, and to
      reject it if not approved by his own rational judgment. They
      expect that he will embrace it in the natural course of things, by
      the mere force of authority and contagion &#8212; as they have adopted
      it themselves: as they have adopted also the current language,
      weights, measures, divisions of time, &amp;c. If he dissents, he
      is guilty of an offence described in the terms of the indictment
      preferred against Sokrates &#8212; &#8220;Sokrates commits crime, inasmuch as
      he does not believe in the Gods, in whom the city believes, but
      introduces new religious beliefs,&#8221; &amp;c.<a

      Plato, when he assumes the function of Constructor, establishes
      special officers for enforcing in detail the authority of King
      Nomos in his Platonic variety. But even <span class="pagenum"><a

        This general fact is powerfully set forth by Cicero, in the
        beginning of the third Tusculan Disputation. Chrysippus the
        Stoic, &#8220;ut est in omni histori&acirc; curiosus,&#8221; had collected
        striking examples of these consecrated practices, cherished in
        one territory, abhorrent elsewhere. (Cic. Tusc. Disp. i. 45,

        of the two Spartans who survived the battle of Thermopyl&aelig;,
        after his return home, Herodot. vii. 231, ix. 71. The
        interdiction from communion of fire, water, eating, sacrifice,
        &amp;c., is the strongest manifestation of repugnance: so
        insupportable to the person excommunicated, that it counted for
        a sentence of exile in the Roman law. (Deinarchus cont.

        Herodotus, as well as elsewhere, that the idea really intended
        to be expressed by the word &#925;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962; is much larger than what is
        now commonly understood by <i>Law</i>. It is equivalent to that
        which Epikt&ecirc;tus calls &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#972;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#8212; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#957;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056;
        &#948;&#972;&#947;&#956;&#945; (Epiktet. iii. 16). It includes what is meant by &#964;&#8056;
        &#957;&#972;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957; (Xenoph. Memor. iv. 4, 13-24), &#964;&#8048; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#945;, &#964;&#8048; &#957;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;,

        social &aelig;sthetical precepts, as well as civil or political,
        and even personal habits, such as that of abstinence from
        spitting or wiping the nose (Xenoph. Cyrop. viii. 8, 8-10). The
        case which Herodotus quotes to illustrate his general thesis is
        the different treatment which, among different nations, is
        considered dutiful and respectful towards senior relatives and
        the corpses of deceased relatives; which matters come under

        every hour&#8217;s proceeding of the citizen through life (Leges, vii.
        807-808-823). </p>
      <p>We find Plato, in the Leges, which represents the altered tone
        and compressive orthodoxy of his old age, extolling the simple
        goodness (&#949;&#8016;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;) of our early forefathers, who believed
        implicitly all that was told them, and were not clever enough to
        raise doubts, &#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#964;&#945;&#957;&#8166;&#957; (Legg. iii. 679, 680). Plato dwells
        much upon the danger of permitting any innovation on the fixed
        modes of song and dance (Legg. v. 727, vii. 797-800), and
        forbids it under heavy penalties. He says that the lawgiver both
        <i>can</i> consecrate common talk, and ought to consecrate it &#8212;
        &#954;&#945;&#952;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#966;&#942;&#956;&#951;&#957; (Legg. 838), the dicta of &#925;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#914;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#962;. </p>
      <p>Pascal describes, in forcible terms, the wide-spread authority
        of &#925;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#914;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#962;:&#8212;&#8220;Il ne faut pas se m&eacute;conna&icirc;tre,
        nous sommes automates autant qu&#8217;esprit: et del&agrave; vient que
        l&#8217;instrument, par lequel la persuasion se fait, n&#8217;est pas la
        seule d&eacute;monstration. Combien y a-t-il peu de choses
        d&eacute;montr&eacute;es! Les preuves ne convainquent que
        l&#8217;esprit. La coutume fait nos preuves les plus fortes et les
        plus crues: <i>elle incline l&#8217;automate, qui entra&icirc;ne
          l&#8217;esprit sans qu&#8217;il y pense</i>. Qui a d&eacute;montr&eacute;
        qu&#8217;il sera demain jour, et que nous mourrons &#8212; et qu&#8217;y a-t-il de
        plus cru? C&#8217;est donc la coutume qui nous en persuade, c&#8217;est elle
        qui fait tant de Chr&eacute;tiens, c&#8217;est elle qui fait les Turcs
        les Paiens, les m&eacute;tiers, les soldats, &amp;c. Enfin, il
        faut avoir recours &agrave; elle quand une fois l&#8217;esprit a vu
        o&ugrave; est la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, afin de nous abreuver et
        nous teindre de cette cr&eacute;ance, qui nous &eacute;chappe
        &agrave; toute heure; car d&#8217;en avoir toujours les preuves
        pr&eacute;sentes, c&#8217;est trop d&#8217;affaire. Il faut acqu&eacute;rir
        une cr&eacute;ance plus facile, qui est celle de l&#8217;habitude,
        qui, sans violence, sans art, sans argument, nous fait croire
        les choses, et incline toutes nos puissances &agrave; cette
        croyance, en sorte que notre &acirc;me y tombe naturellement.
        Quand on ne croit que par la force de la conviction, et que
        l&#8217;automate est inclin&eacute; &agrave; croire le contraire, ce
        n&#8217;est pas assez.&#8221; (Pascal, Pens&eacute;es, ch. xi. p. 237, ed.
        Louandre, Paris, 1854.) </p>
      <p>Herein Pascal coincides with Montaigne, of whom he often speaks
        harshly enough: &#8220;Comme de vray nous n&#8217;avons aultre mire de la
        v&eacute;rit&eacute; et de la raison, que l&#8217;exemple et
        id&eacute;e des opinions et usances du pa&iuml;s o&ugrave; nous
        sommes: l&agrave; est tousiours la parfaicte religion, la
        parfaicte police, parfaict et accomply usage de toutes choses.&#8221;
        (Essais de Montaigne, liv. i. ch. 30.) Compare the same train of
        thought in Descartes (Discours sur la M&eacute;thode, pp.
        132-139, ed. Cousin).</p>

      <p>Compare also about the sense of the word <i>Lex</i>, as
        conceived by the Arabs, M. Renan, Averro&egrave;s, p. 286, and
        Mr. Mill&#8217;s chapter respecting the all-comprehensive character of
        the Hindoo law (Hist. of India, ch. iv., beginning): &#8220;In the law
        books of the Hindus, the details of jurisprudence and judicature
        occupy comparatively a very moderate space. The doctrines and
        ceremonies of religion; the rules and practice of education; the
        institutions, duties, and customs of domestic life; the maxims
        of private morality, and even of domestic economy; the rules of
        government, of war, and of negotiation; all form essential parts
        of the Hindu code of law, and are treated in the same style, and
        laid down with the same authority, as the rules for the
        distribution of justice.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Mr. Maine, in his admirable work on Ancient Law, notes both the
        all-comprehensive and the irresistible ascendancy of what is
        called <i>Law</i> in early societies. He remarks emphatically
        that &#8220;the stationary condition of the human race is the rule &#8212;
        the progressive condition the exception &#8212; a rare exception in
        the history of the world&#8221;. (Chap. i. pp. 16-18-19; chap. ii. pp.
        22-24.) </p>
      <p>Again, Mr. Maine observes:&#8212;&#8220;The other liability, to which the
        infancy of society is exposed, has prevented or arrested the
        progress of far the greater part of mankind. The rigidity of
        ancient law, arising chiefly from its early association and
        identification with religion, has chained down the mass of the
        human race to those views of life and conduct which they
        entertained at the time when their institutions were first
        consolidated into a systematic form. There were one or two races
        exempted by a marvellous fate from this calamity: and grafts
        from these stocks have fertilised a few modern societies. But it
        is still true that over the larger part of the world, the
        perfection of law has always been considered as consisting in
        adherence to the ground-plan supposed to have been marked out by
        the legislator. <i>If intellect has in such cases been
          exercised upon jurisprudence, it has uniformly prided itself
          on the subtle perversity of the conclusions it could build on
          ancient texts, without discoverable departure from their
          literal tenor.</i>&#8221; (Maine, Ancient Law, ch. iv. pp. 77-78.)</p>

      <p>Hegel adverts to this severance of the individual consciousness
        from the common consciousness of the community, as the point of
        departure for philosophical theory:&#8212;&#8220;On one hand we are now
        called upon to find some specific matter for the general form of
        Good; such closer determination of The Good is the criterion
        required. On the other hand, the exigencies of the individual
        subject come prominently forward: this is the consequence of the
        revolution which Sokrates operated in the Greek mind. So long as
        the religion, the laws, the political constitution, of any
        people, are in full force &#8212; so long as each individual citizen
        is in complete harmony with them all &#8212; no one raises the
        question, What has the Individual to do for himself? In a
        moralised and religious social harmony, each individual finds
        his destination prescribed by the established routine; while
        this positive morality, religion, laws, form also the routine of
        <i>his own</i> mind. On the contrary, if the Individual no
        longer stands on the custom of his nation, nor feels himself in
        full agreement with the religion and laws &#8212; he then no longer
        finds what he desires, nor obtains satisfaction in the medium
        around him. When once such discord has become confirmed, the
        Individual must fall back on his own reflections, and seek his
        destination there. This is what gives rise to the question &#8212;
        What is the essential scheme for the Individual? To what ought
        he to conform &#8212; what shall he aim at? An <i>ideal</i> is thus
        set up for the Individual. This is, the Wise Man, or the Ideal
        of the Wise Man, which is, in truth, the separate working of
        individual self-consciousness, conceived as an universal or
        typical character.&#8221; (Hegel, Geschichte der Philosophie, Part ii.

    <p>Amidst the epic and lyric poets of Greece, with their varied
      productive impulse &#8212; as well as amidst the Gnomic philosophers,
      the best of whom were also poets &#8212; there are not a few
      manifestations of such freely judging individuality. Xenophanes
      the philosopher, who wrote in poetry, censured severely several of
      the current narratives about the Gods and Pindar, though in more
      respectful terms, does the like. So too, the theories about the
      Kosmos, propounded by various philosophers, Thales, Anaximenes,
      Pythagoras, Herakleitus, Anaxagoras, &amp;c., were each of them
      the free offspring of an individual mind. But these were
      counter-affirmations: novel theories, departing from the common
      belief, yet accompanied by little or no debate, or attack, or
      defence: indeed the proverbial obscurity of Herakleitus, and the
      recluse mysticism of the Pythagoreans, almost excluded discussion.
      These philosophers (to use the phrase of Aristotle<a

        Aristot. Metaphys. A. 987, b. 32. Eusebius, having set forth the
        dissentient and discordant opinions of the various Hellenic
        philosophers, triumphantly contrasts with them the steady
        adherence of Jews and Christians to one body of truth, handed
        down by an uniform tradition from father to son, from the first
        generation of man &#8212; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962;. (Pr&aelig;p. Ev.

      <p>Cicero, in the treatise (not preserved) entitled <i>Hortensius</i>
        &#8212; set forth, at some length, an attack and a defence of
        philosophy; the former he assigned to Hortensius, the latter he
        undertook in his own name. One of the arguments urged by
        Hortensius against philosophy, to prove that it was not &#8220;vera
        sapientia,&#8221; was, that it was both a human invention and a recent
        novelty, not handed down by tradition <i>a principio</i>,
        therefore not natural to man. &#8220;Qu&aelig; si secundum hominis
        naturam est, cum homine ipso c&#339;perit necesse est; si vero non
        est, nec capere quidem illam posset humana natura. Ubi apud
        antiquiores latuit amor iste investigand&aelig; veritatis?&#8221;
        (Lactantius, Inst. Divin. iii. 16.) The loss of this Ciceronian
        pleading (Philosophy <i>versus</i> Consecrated Tradition) is
        much to be deplored. Lactantius and Augustin seem to have used
        it largely. </p>
      <p>The Hermotimus of Lucian, manifesting all his lively Sokratic
        acuteness, is a dialogue intended to expose the worthlessness of
        all speculative philosophy. The respondent Hermotimus happens to
        be a Stoic, but the assailant expressly declares (c. 85) that
        the arguments would be equally valid against Platonists or
        Aristotelians. Hermotimus is advised to desist from philosophy,
        to renounce inquiry, to employ himself in some of the necessary
        affairs of life, and to acquiesce in the common received
        opinions, which would carry him smoothly along the remainder of
        his life (&#7936;&#958;&#953;&#8182; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8005; &#963;&#949; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#941;&#956;&#968;&#949;&#953; &#7952;&#962;

    <p>Both the drama and the dikastery recognise two or more different
      ways of looking at a question, and require that no conclusion
      shall be pronounced until opposing disputants have been heard and
      compared. The Eumenides plead against Apollo, Prometheus against
      the mandates and dispositions of Zeus, in spite of the superior
      dignity as well as power with which Zeus is invested: every
      Athenian citizen, in his character of dikast, took an oath to hear
      both the litigant parties alike, and to decide upon the pleadings
      and evidence according to law. Zeno, in his debates with the
      anti-Parmenidean philosophers, did not trouble himself to parry
      their thrusts. He assumed the aggressive, impugned the theories of
      his opponents, and exposed the contradictions in which they
      involved themselves. The dialectic process, in which there are (at

    <p>I have in a former <a href="#Sidenotev1_2_12">chapter</a>
      explained the dialectic of Zeno, as it bore upon the theories of
      the anti-Parmenidean philosophers. Still more important was the
      proceeding of Sokrates, when he applied the like scrutiny to
      ethical, social, political, religious topics. He did not come
      forward with any counter-theories: he declared expressly that he
      had none to propose, and that he was ignorant. He put questions to
      those who on their side professed to know, and he invited answers
      from them. His mission, as he himself described it, was, to
      scrutinise and expose false pretensions to knowledge. Without such
      scrutiny, he declares life itself to be not worth having. He
      impugned the common and traditional creed, not in the name of any
      competing doctrine, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page386"

      familiar terms in which it was confidently enunciated, and by

      their own contradictions. The persons who held it were shown to be
      incapable of defending it, when tested by an acute cross-examiner;
      and their supposed knowledge, gathered up insensibly from the
      tradition around them, deserved the language which Bacon applies
      to the science of his day, conducting indirectly to the necessity
      of that remedial course which Bacon recommends. &#8220;Nemo adhuc

        Bacon, Nov. Org. Aph. 97. I have already cited this passage in a
        note on the 68th chapter of my &#8216;History of Greece,&#8217; pp. 612-613;
        in which note I have also alluded to other striking passages of
        Bacon, indicating the confusion, inconsistencies, and
        misapprehensions of the &#8220;<i>intellectus sibi permissus</i>&#8221;. In
        that note, and in the text of the chapter, I have endeavoured to
        illustrate the same view of the Sokratic procedure as that which
        is here taken.</p>

    <p>Never before (so far as we know) had the authority of King Nomos
      been exposed to such an enemy as this dialectic or
      cross-examination by Sokrates: the prescriptive creed and
      unconsciously imbibed sentiment (&#8220;ratio ex fide, casu, et
      puerilibus notionibus&#8221;) being thrown upon their defence against
      negative scrutiny brought to bear upon them by the inquisitive
      reason of an individual citizen. In the Apology, Sokrates clothes
      his own strong intellectual <i>&#339;strus</i> in the belief
      (doubtless sincerely entertained) of a divine mission. In the
      Gorgias, the Platonic Sokrates asserts it in naked and simple, yet
      not less emphatic, language. &#8220;You, Polus, bring against me the
      authority of the multitude, as well as that of the most eminent
      citizens, all of whom agree in upholding your view. But I, one man
      standing here alone, do <i>not</i> agree with you. And I engage
      to compel you, my one respondent, to agree with <i>me</i>.&#8221;<a

        the negative procedure of Sokrates. Mistake of supposing that
        that negative procedure belongs peculiarly to the Sophists and
        the Megarici.</span></p>
    <p>With such a career, we need not wonder that Sokrates, though
      esteemed and admired by a select band of adherents, incurred a
      large amount of general unpopularity. The public (as I have before
      observed) do not admit the claim of independent exercise for
      individual reason. In the natural process of growth in the human
      mind, belief does not follow proof, but springs up apart from and
      independent of it: an immature intelligence believes first, and
      proves (if indeed it ever seeks proof) afterwards.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_78" href="#Footnotev1_8_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a>
      This mental tendency is farther confirmed by the pressure and
      authority of King Nomos; who is peremptory in exacting belief, but
      neither furnishes nor requires proof. The community, themselves
      deeply persuaded, will not hear with calmness the voice of a
      solitary reasoner, adverse to opinions thus established; nor do
      they like to be required to explain, analyse, or reconcile those
      opinions.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_79" href="#Footnotev1_8_79"><span

      debate which gives free play and efficacious prominence to the
      negative arm. The like disapprobation is felt even by most of the
      historians of philosophy; who nevertheless, having an interest in
      the philosophising process, might be supposed to perceive that
      nothing worthy of being called <i>reasoned truth</i> can exist,
      without full and equal scope to negative as well as to

        This antithesis and reciprocal repulsion &#8212; between the
        speculative reason of the philosopher who thinks for himself,
        and the established traditional convictions of the public &#8212; is
        nowhere more strikingly enforced than by Plato in the sixth and
        seventh books of the Republic; together with the corrupting
        influence exercised by King Nomos, at the head of his vehement
        and unanimous public, over those few gifted natures which are
        competent to philosophical speculation. See Plato, Rep. vi.
        492-493. </p>
      <p>The unfavourable feelings with which the attempts to analyse
        morality (especially when quite novel, as such attempts were in
        the time of Sokrates) are received in a community &#8212; are noticed
        by Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his tract on Utilitarianism, ch.
        iii. pp. 38-39:&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;The question is often asked, and properly so, in regard to any
        supposed moral standard, What is its sanction? What are the
        motives to obey it? or more specifically, What is the source of
        its obligation? Whence does it derive its binding force? It is a
        necessary part of moral philosophy to provide the answer to this
        question: which though frequently assuming the shape of an
        objection to the utilitarian morality, as if it had some special
        applicability to that above others, really arises in <i>regard
          to all standards</i>. It arises in fact whenever a person is
        called on to adopt a standard, or refer morality to any basis on
        which he has not been accustomed to rest it. For the customary
        morality, that which education and opinion have consecrated, is
        the only one which presents itself to the mind with the feeling
        of being <i>in itself</i> obligatory: and when a person is
        asked to believe that this morality <i>derives</i> its
        obligation from some general principle round which custom has
        not thrown the same halo, the assertion is to him a paradox. The
        supposed corollaries seem to have a more binding force than the
        original theorem: the superstructure seems to stand better
        without than with what is represented as its foundation.&#8230; The
        difficulty has no peculiar application to the doctrine of
        utility, but is inherent in every attempt to analyse morality,
        and reduce it to principles: which, unless the principle is
        already in men&#8217;s minds invested with as much sacredness as any
        of its applications, always seems to divest them of a part of
        their sanctity.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Epikt&ecirc;tus observes that the refined doctrines acquired by
        the self-reasoning philosopher, often failed to attain that
        intense hold on his conviction, which the &#8220;rotten doctrines&#8221;
        inculcated from childhood possessed over the conviction of
        ordinary men. &#916;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#943; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#953; (&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054;, &#959;&#7985; &#7984;&#948;&#953;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953;) &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;

    <p>These historians usually speak in very harsh terms of the
      Sophists, as well as of Eukleides and the Megaric sect; who are
      taken as the great apostles of negation. But the truth is, that
      the Megarics inherited it from Sokrates, and shared it with Plato.
      Eukleides cannot have laid down a larger programme of negation
      than that which we read in the Apology of Sokrates, &#8212; nor composed
      a dialogue more ultra-negative than the Platonic Parmenid&ecirc;s:
      nor, again, did he depart so widely, in principle as well as in

      making the worse appear the better reason &#8212; subversion of

      <p>We read in Zeller&#8217;s account of the Platonic philosophy (Phil.

      <p>&#8220;Die prop&auml;deutische Begr&uuml;ndung der Platonischen
        Philosophie besteht im Allgemeinen darin, dass der
        unphilosophische Standpunkt aufgel&ouml;st, und die Erhebung zum
        philosophischen in ihrer Nothwendigkeit nachgewiesen wird. Im
        Besondern k&ouml;nnen wir drey Stadien dieses Wegs
        unterscheiden. Den Ausgangspunkt bildet das gew&ouml;hnliche
        Bewusstsein. Indem die <i>Voraussetzungen, welche Diesem
          f&uuml;r ein Erstes und Festes gegolten hatten, dialektisch
          zersetzt werden, so erhalten wir zun&auml;chst das negative
          Resultat der Sophistik</i>. Erst wenn auch diese
        &uuml;berwunden ist, kann der philosophische Standpunkt positiv

      <p>Zeller here affirms that it was the Sophists (Protagoras,
        Prodikus, Hippias and others) who first applied negative
        analysis to the common consciousness; breaking up, by their
        dialectic scrutiny, those hypotheses which had before exercised
        authority therein, as first principles not to be disputed. </p>
      <p>I dissent from this position. I conceive that the Sophists
        (Protagoras, Prodikus, Hippias) did <i>not</i> do what Zeller
        affirms, and that Sokrates (and Plato after him) <i>did</i> do
        it. The negative analysis was the weapon of Sokrates, and not of
        Protagoras, Prodikus, Hippias, &amp;c. It was he who declared
        (see Platonic Apology) that false persuasion of knowledge was at
        once universal and ruinous, and who devoted his life to the task
        of exposing it by cross-examination. The conversation of the
        Xenophontic Sokrates with Euthyd&ecirc;mus (Memor. iv. 2),
        exhibits a complete specimen of that aggressive analysis,
        brought to bear on the common consciousness, which Zeller
        ascribes to the Sophists: the Platonic dialogues, in which
        Sokrates cross-examines upon Justice, Temperance, Courage,
        Piety, Virtue, &amp;c., are of the like character; and we know
        from Xenophon (Mem. i. 1-16) that Sokrates passed much time in
        such examinations with pre-eminent success. </p>
      <p>I notice this statement of Zeller, not because it is peculiar
        to him (for most of the modern historians of philosophy affirm
        the same; and his history, which is the best that I know, merely
        repeats the ordinary view), but because it illustrates clearly
        the view which I take of the Sophists and Sokrates. Instead of
        the unmeaning abstract &#8220;<i>Sophistik</i>,&#8221; given by Zeller and
        others, we ought properly to insert the word &#8220;<i>Sokratik</i>,&#8221;
        if we are to have any abstract term at all. </p>
      <p>Again &#8212; The negative analysis, which these authors call
        &#8220;Sophistik,&#8221; they usually censure as discreditable and
        corrupting. To me it appears, on the contrary, both original and
        valuable, as one essential condition for bringing social and
        ethical topics under the domain of philosophy or &#8220;reasoned
        truth&#8221;. </p>
      <p>Professor Charles Thurot (in his &Eacute;tudes sur Aristote,
        Paris, 1860, p. 119) takes a juster view than Zeller of the
        difference between Plato and the Sophists (Protagoras, Prodikus,
        Hippias). &#8220;Les Sophistes, comme tous ceux qui dissertent
        superficiellement sur des questions de philosophie, et en
        particulier sur la morale et la politique, s&#8217;appuyaient sur
        l&#8217;autorit&eacute; et le t&eacute;moignage; ils
        all&eacute;guaient les vers des po&egrave;tes
        c&eacute;l&egrave;bres qui passaient aux yeux des Grecs pour des
        oracles de sagesse: ils invoquaient l&#8217;opinion du commun des
        hommes. Platon r&eacute;cusait absolument ces deux
        esp&egrave;ces de t&eacute;moignages. Ni les po&egrave;tes ni le
        commun des hommes ne savent ce qu&#8217;ils disent, puisqu&#8217;ils ne
        peuvent en rendre raison....... Aux yeux de Platon, il n&#8217;y a
        d&#8217;autre m&eacute;thode, pour arriver au vrai et pour le
        communiquer, que la dialectique: qui est &agrave; la fois l&#8217;art
        d&#8217;interroger et de r&eacute;pondre, et l&#8217;art de d&eacute;finir
        et de diviser.&#8221; </p>
      <p>M. Thurot here declares (in my judgment very truly) that the
        Sophists appealed to the established ethical authorities, and
        dwelt upon or adorned the received common-places &#8212; that Plato
        denied these authorities, and brought his battery of negative
        cross-examination to bear upon them as well as upon their
        defenders. M. Thurot thus gives a totally different version of
        the procedure of the Sophists from that which is given by
        Zeller. Nevertheless he perfectly agrees with Zeller, and with
        Anytus, the accuser of Sokrates (Plat. Menon, pp. 91-92), in
        describing the Sophists as a class who made money by deceiving
        and perverting the minds of hearers (p. 120).</p>

        See this point strikingly set forth by Plato, Politikus, 299:
        also Plutarch, &#7960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;, c. 13, 756 A. </p>
      <p>This is the &#8220;auctoritas majorum,&#8221; put forward by Cotta in his

        when reasons are produced to sustain it, the reasons fail. (Cic.

      <p>The &#8220;auctoritas maiorum,&#8221; proclaimed by the Pontifex Cotta, may

      antipathy common to men in other respects very different, to
      Nikias as well as Kleon, to Eupolis and Aristophanes as well as to
      Anytus and Demochares. It was expressed forcibly by the Roman Cato
      (the Censor), when he censured Sokrates as a dangerous and violent
      citizen; aiming, in his own way, to subvert the institutions and
      customs of the country, and poisoning the minds of his

      <p>These astute cavils and quibbles of Euripides are attributed by
        Aristophanes, and the other comic writers, to his frequent
        conversations with Sokrates. Ran&aelig;, 1490-1500. Dionys. Hal.
        Ars Rhet. p. 301-355. Valckenaer, Diatribe in Euripid. c. 4.
        Aristophanes describes Sokrates as having stolen a garment from
        the pal&aelig;stra (Nubes, 180); and Eupolis also introduces him
        as having stolen a wine-ladle (Schol. ad loc. Eupolis, Fragm.
        Incert. ix. ed. Meineke). The fragment of Eupolis (xi. p. 553,
        &#7944;&#948;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#958;&#959;&#957;, &#8038; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;) seems to apply to
        Sokrates. About the sympathy of the people with the attacks of
        the comic writers on Sokrates, see Lucian, Piscat. c. 25. </p>
      <p>The rhetor Aristeides (Orat. xlvi. &#8025;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#932;&#949;&#964;&#964;&#940;&#961;&#969;&#957;, pp.

        general manner in which the title &#931;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962; was applied among the
        Greeks (Herodotus having so designated both Solon and
        Pythagoras), mentions that Androtion not only spoke of the seven
        wise men as &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7957;&#960;&#964;&#945; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#962;, but also called Sokrates
        &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#965;: that Lysias called Plato &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#957;, and
        called &AElig;schines (the Sokratic) by the same title; that
        Isokrates represented himself, and rhetors and politicians like
        himself, as &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;&#962;, while he termed the dialecticians and
        critics &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#962;. Nothing could be more indeterminate than these
        names, &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962; and &#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#962;. It was Plato who applied himself

        Plato, Menon, pp. 90-92. The antipathy manifested here by Anytus
        against the Sophists, is the same feeling which led him to
        indict Sokrates, and which induced also Cato the Censor to hate
        the character of Sokrates, and Greek letters generally.

      <p>Here the dissenter who proclaims his sincere convictions is
        spoken of with respect: compare the contrary feeling, Leges, ix.
        881 A, and in the tenth book generally. In the striking passage
        of the Republic, referred to in a previous <a
          href="#Footnotev1_8_79">note</a> (vi. 492) Plato declares the
        lessons taught by the multitude &#8212; the contagion of established
        custom and tradition, communicated by the crowd of earnest
        assembled believers &#8212; to be of overwhelming and almost
        omnipotent force. The individual philosopher (he says), who
        examines for himself and tries to stand against it, can hardly
        maintain himself without special divine aid.</p>

        In the dialogue called Politikus, Plato announces formally and
        explicitly (what the historical Sokrates had asserted before
        him, Xen. Mem. iii. 9, 10) the exclusive pretensions of the
        &#914;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#932;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; (representing political science, art, or
        theory) to rule mankind &#8212; the illusory nature of all other
        titles to rule and the mischievous working of all existing
        governments. The same view is developed in the Republic and the
        Leges. Compare also Aristotel. Ethic. Nikom. x. p. 1180, b. 27 ad
        fin. </p>
      <p>In a remarkable passage of the Leges (i. 637 D, 638 C), Plato
        observes, in touching upon the discrepancy between different
        local institutions at Sparta, Krete, Keos. Tarentum,
        &amp;c.:&#8212;&#8220;If natives of different cities argue with each other
        about their respective institutions, each of them has a good and
        sufficient reason. This is the custom <i>with us; with you
          perhaps it is different</i>. But we, who are now conversing,
        do not apply our criticisms to the private citizen; we criticise

    <p>The dislike so constantly felt by communities having established

      The name of Sokrates, after his death, was employed not merely by
      Plato, but by all the Sokratic companions, to cover their own
      ethical speculations: moreover, all of them either composed works
      or gave lectures. But in either case, readers or hearers were
      comparatively few in number, and were chiefly persons prompted by
      some special taste or interest: while Sokrates passed his day in
      the most public place, eager to interrogate every one, and
      sometimes forcing his interrogations even upon reluctant hearers.<a

    </div>
    <p>However this may be, it is from the conversation of Sokrates that
      the Platonic Dialogues of Search take their rise, and we must read
      them under those same fundamental postulates which Sokrates
      enunciates to the Dikasts. &#8220;False persuasion of knowledge is
      almost universal: the Elenchus, which eradicates this, is salutary
      and indispensable: the dialectic search for truth between two
      active, self-working minds, both of them ignorant, yet both
      feeling their own ignorance, is instructive, as well as
      fascinating, though it should end without finding any truth at
      all, and without any other result than that of discovering some
      proposed hypotheses to be untrue.&#8221; The modern reader must be
      invited to keep these postulates in mind, if he would fairly
      appreciate the Platonic Dialogues of Search. He must learn to
      esteem the mental exercise of free debate as valuable in itself,<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_91" href="#Footnotev1_8_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
      even though the goal recedes before him in proportion to the steps
      which he makes in advance. He perceives a lively antithesis of
      opinions, several distinct and dissentient points of view opened,
      various tentatives of advance made and broken off. He has the
      first half of the process of truth-seeking, without the last; and
      even without full certainty that the last half can be worked out,
      or that the problem as propounded is one which admits of an
      affirmative solution.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_92"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> But Plato
      presumes that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page395"

      the same interlocutors or by others. He reckons upon responsive
      energy in the youthful subject; he addresses himself to men of
      earnest purpose and stirring intellect, who will be spurred on by
      the dialectic exercise itself to farther pursuit &#8212; men who, having
      listened to the working out of different points of view, will
      meditate on these points for themselves, and apply a judicial
      estimate conformable to the measure of their own minds. Those
      respondents, who, after having been puzzled and put to shame by
      one cross-examination, became disgusted and never presented
      themselves again &#8212; were despised by Sokrates as lazy and stupid.<a

        Xenoph. Mem. iv. 2, 40. </p>
      <p>Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his Essay on Liberty, has the
        following remarks, illustrating Plato&#8217;s Dialogues of Search. I
        should have been glad if I could have transcribed here many
        other pages of that admirable Essay: which stands almost alone
        as an unreserved vindication of the rights of the searching
        individual intelligence, against the compression and repression
        of King Nomos (pp. 79-80-81):&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;The loss of so important an aid to the intelligent and living
        apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by the necessity of
        explaining it to or defending it against opponents, though not
        sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the
        benefits of its universal recognition. Where this advantage
        cannot be had, I confess I should like to see the teachers of
        mankind endeavouring to provide a substitute for it: some
        contrivance for making the difficulties of the question as
        present to the learner&#8217;s consciousness, as if they were pressed
        upon him by a dissentient champion eager for his conversion. </p>
      <p>&#8220;But instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they
        have lost those they formerly had. The Sokratic dialectics, so
        magnificently exemplified in the dialogues of Plato, were a
        contrivance of this description. They were essentially a
        discussion of the great questions of life and philosophy,
        directed with consummate skill to the purpose of convincing any
        one, who had merely adopted the common-places of received
        opinion, that he did not understand the subject &#8212; that he as yet
        attached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed: in
        order that, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in
        the way to attain a stable belief, resting on a clear
        apprehension both of the meaning of doctrines and of their
        evidence. The school-disputations of the middle ages had a
        similar object. They were intended to make sure that the pupil
        understood his own opinion, and (by necessary correlation) the
        opinion opposed to it &#8212; and could enforce the grounds of the one
        and confute those of the other. These last-mentioned contests
        had indeed the incurable defect, that the premisses appealed to
        were taken from authority, not from reason; and as a discipline
        to the mind they were in every respect inferior to the powerful
        dialectics which formed the intellects of the &#8216;Socratici viri&#8217;.
        But the modern mind owes far more to both than it is generally
        willing to admit; and the present modes of instruction contain
        nothing which in the smallest degree supplies the place either
        of the one or of the other.&#8230; It is the fashion of the present
        time to disparage negative logic &#8212; that which points out
        weaknesses in theory or errors in practice, without establishing
        positive truths. Such negative criticism would indeed be poor
        enough as an ultimate result, but as a means to attaining any
        positive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it cannot be
        valued too highly; and until people are again systematically
        trained to it, there will be few great thinkers, and a low
        general average of intellect, in any but the mathematical and
        physical departments of speculation. On any other subject no
        one&#8217;s opinions deserve the name of knowledge, except so far as
        he has either had forced upon him by others, or gone through of
        himself, the same mental process which would have been required
        of him in carrying on an active controversy with opponents.&#8221;</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_8_51"></a>Result called <i>Knowledge</i>,
        which Plato aspires to. Power of going through a Sokratic cross
        examination; not attainable except through the Platonic process
        and method.</span></p>
    <p>Another matter must here be noticed, in regard to these Dialogues
      of Search. We must understand how Plato conceived the goal towards
      which they tend: that is the state of mind which he calls <i>knowledge</i>
      or <i>cognition</i>. Knowledge (in his view) is not attained
      until the mind is brought into clear view of the Universal Forms
      or Ideas, and intimate communion with them: but the test (as I
      have already observed) for determining whether a man has yet
      attained this end or not, is to ascertain whether he can give to
      others a full account of all that he professes to know, and can
      extract from them a full account of all that they profess to know:
      whether he can perform, in a manner exhaustive as well as
      unerring, the double and correlative function of asking and
      answering: in other words, whether he can administer the Sokratic
      cross-examination effectively to others, and reply to it without
      faltering or contradiction when administered to himself.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_94" href="#Footnotev1_8_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a>
      Such being the way in which Plato conceives knowledge, we may
      easily see that it cannot be produced, or even approached, by
      direct, demonstrative, didactic communication: by simply
      announcing to the hearer, and lodging in his memory, a theorem to
      be proved, together with the steps whereby it is proved. He must
      be made familiar with each subject on many sides, and under
      several different aspects and analogies: he must have had before
      him objections with their refutation, and <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page397" id="v1page397"></a>397</span>the fallacious
      arguments which appear to prove the theorem, but do not really
      prove it:<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_95" href="#Footnotev1_8_95"><span
          class="sp">95</span></a> he must be introduced to the
      principal counter-theorems, with the means whereby an opponent
      will enforce them: he must be practised in the use of equivocal
      terms and sophistry, either to be detected when the opponent is
      cross-examining him, or to be employed when he is cross-examining
      an opponent. All these accomplishments must be acquired, together
      with full promptitude and flexibility, before he will be competent
      to perform those two difficult functions, which Plato considers to
      be the test of knowledge. You may say that such a result is
      indefinitely distant and hopeless: Plato considers it attainable,
      though he admits the arduous efforts which it will cost. But the
      point which I wish to show is, that if attainable at all, it can
      only be attained through a long and varied course of such
      dialectic discussion as that which we read in the Platonic
      Dialogues of Search. The state and aptitude of mind called
      knowledge, can only be generated as a last result of this
      continued practice (to borrow an expression of Longinus).<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_96" href="#Footnotev1_8_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a>
      The Platonic method is thus in perfect harmony and co-ordination
      with the Platonic result, as described and pursued. </p>

        On this point the scholastic manner of handling in the Middle

        nous avons tout son syst&egrave;me sur l&#8217;origine des
        id&eacute;es, et nous pouvons croire qu&#8217;il n&#8217;a plus rien
        &agrave; nous apprendre &agrave; ce sujet: mais en scolastique,
        il ne suffit pas de d&eacute;montrer, par deux ou trois
        arguments, r&eacute;put&eacute;s invincibles, ce que l&#8217;on
        suppose &ecirc;tre la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, il faut, en outre,
        r&eacute;pondre aux objections premi&egrave;re, seconde,
        troisi&egrave;me, &amp;c., &amp;c., de divers interlocuteurs,
        souvent imaginaires; il faut &eacute;tablir la parfaite
        concordance de la conclusion enonc&eacute;e et des conclusions
        prec&eacute;dents ou subs&eacute;quentes; il faut
        r&eacute;produire, &agrave; l&#8217;occasion de tout probl&egrave;me

        topics &#8212; man and society.</span></p>
    <p>Moreover, not merely method and result are in harmony, but also
      the topics discussed. These topics were ethical, social, and
      political: matters especially human<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_97"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> (to use
      the phrase of Sokrates himself) familiar to every man, &#8212; handled,
      unphilosophically, by speakers in the assembly, pleaders in the
      dikastery, dramatists in the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page398" id="v1page398"></a>398</span>theatre. Now it
      is exactly upon such topics that debate can be made most
      interesting, varied, and abundant. The facts, multifarious in
      themselves, connected with man and society, depend upon a variety
      of causes, co-operating and conflicting. Account must be taken of
      many different points of view, each of which has a certain range
      of application, and each of which serves to limit or modify the
      others: the generalities, even when true, are true only on the
      balance, and under ordinary circumstances; <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page399" id="v1page399"></a>399</span>they are liable
      to exception, if those circumstances undergo important change.
      There are always objections, real as well as apparent, which
      require to be rebutted or elucidated. To such changeful and
      complicated states of fact, the Platonic dialectic was adapted:
      furnishing abundant premisses and comparisons, bringing into
      notice many distinct points of view, each of which must be looked
      at and appreciated, before any tenable principle can be arrived
      at. Not only Platonic method and result, but also Platonic topics,
      are thus well suited to each other. The general terms of ethics
      were familiar but undefined: the tentative definitions suggested,
      followed up by objections available against each, included a large
      and instructive survey of ethical phenomena in all their bearings.

        Xenoph. Memor. i. 1, 12-15. I transcribe the following passage
        from an article in the Edinburgh Review (April, 1866, pp.
        325-326), on the first edition of the present work: an article
        not merely profound and striking as to thought, but indicating
        the most comprehensive study and appreciation of the Platonic
        writings:&#8212;</p>
      <p>&#8220;The enemy against whom Plato really fought, and the warfare
        against whom was the incessant occupation of his life and
        writings, was &#8212; not Sophistry, either in the ancient or modern
        sense of the term, but &#8212; <i>Commonplace</i>. It was the
        acceptance of traditional opinions and current sentiments as an
        ultimate fact; and bandying of the abstract terms which express
        approbation and disapprobation, desire and aversion, admiration
        and disgust, as if they had a meaning thoroughly understood and
        universally assented to. The men of his day (like those of ours)
        thought that they knew what Good and Evil, Just and Unjust,
        Honourable and Shameful, were &#8212; because they could use the words
        glibly, and affirm them of this or that, in agreement with
        existing custom. But what the property was, which these several
        instances possessed in common, justifying the application of the
        term, nobody had considered; neither the Sophists, nor the
        rhetoricians, nor the statesmen, nor any of those who set
        themselves up, or were set up by others, as wise. Yet whoever
        could not answer this question was wandering in darkness &#8212; had
        no standard by which his judgments were regulated, and which
        kept them consistent with one another &mdash; no rule which he knew and
        could stand by for the guidance of his life. Not knowing what
        Justice and Virtue are, it was impossible to be just and
        virtuous: not knowing what Good is, we not only fail to reach
        it, but are certain to embrace evil instead. Such a condition,
        to any one capable of thought, made life not worth having. The
        grand business of human intellect ought to consist in subjecting
        these terms to the most rigorous scrutiny, and bringing to light
        the ideas that lie at the bottom of them. Even if this cannot be
        done and real knowledge attained, it is already no small benefit
        to expel the false opinion of knowledge: to make men conscious
        of the things most needful to be known, fill them with shame and
        uneasiness at their own state, and rouse a pungent internal
        stimulus, summoning up all their energies to attack those
        greatest of all problems, and never rest until, as far as
        possible, the true solutions are reached. This is Plato&#8217;s notion
        of the condition of the human mind in his time, and of what
        philosophy could do to help it: and any one who does not think
        the description applicable, with slight modifications, to the
        majority of educated minds in our own time and in all times
        known to us, certainly has not brought either the teachers or
        the practical men of any time to the Platonic test.&#8221; </p>
      <p>The Reviewer farther illustrates this impressive description by
        a valuable citation from Max M&uuml;ller to the same purpose
        (Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, pp.
        520-527). &#8220;Such terms as Nature, Law, Freedom, Necessity, Body,
        Substance, Matter, Church, State, Revelation, Inspiration,
        Knowledge, Belief, &amp;c., are tossed about in the war of words
        as if every body knew what they meant, and as if every body used
        them exactly in the same sense; whereas most people, and
        particularly those who represent public opinion, pick up these
        complicated terms as children, beginning with the vaguest
        conceptions, adding to them from time to time &#8212; perhaps
        correcting likewise at haphazard some of their involuntary
        errors &#8212; but never taking stock, never either enquiring into the
        history of the terms which they handle so freely, or realising
        the fulness of their meaning according to the strict rules of
        logical definition.&#8221;</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_53"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_53"></a>Plato does not provide solutions for
        the difficulties which he has raised. The affirmative and
        negative veins are in him completely distinct. His dogmas are
        enunciations <i>&agrave; priori</i> of some impressive
        sentiment.</span></p>
    <p>The negative procedure is so conspicuous, and even so
      preponderant, in the Platonic dialogues, that no historian of
      philosophy can omit to notice it. But many of them (like Xenophon
      in describing Sokrates) assign to it only a subordinate place and
      a qualified application: while some (and Schleiermacher
      especially) represent all the doubts and difficulties in the
      negative dialogues as exercises to call forth the intellectual
      efforts of the reader, preparatory to full and satisfactory
      solutions which Plato has given in the dogmatic dialogues at the
      end. The first half of this hypothesis I accept: the last half I
      believe to be unfounded. The doubts and difficulties were
      certainly exercises to the mind of Plato himself, and were
      intended as exercises to his readers; but he has nowhere provided
      a key to the solution of them. Where he propounds positive dogmas,
      he does not bring them face to face with objections, nor verify
      their authority by showing that they afford satisfactory solution
      of the difficulties exhibited in his negative procedure. The two
      currents of his speculation, the affirmative and the negative, are
      distinct and independent of each other. Where the affirmative is
      especially present (as in Tim&aelig;us), the negative altogether
      disappears. Tim&aelig;us is made to proclaim the most sweeping
      theories, not one of which the real Sokrates would have suffered
      to pass without abundant cross-examination: but the Platonic
      Sokrates hears them with respect<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page400" id="v1page400"></a>400</span>ful silence, and
      commends afterwards. The declaration so often made by Sokrates
      that he is a searcher, not a teacher &#8212; that he feels doubts keenly
      himself, and can impress them upon others, but cannot discover any
      good solution of them &#8212; this declaration, which is usually
      considered mere irony, is literally true.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_98"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a> The
      Platonic theory of Objective Ideas separate and absolute, which
      the commentators often announce as if it cleared up all
      difficulties &#8212; not only clears up none, but introduces fresh ones
      belonging to itself. When Plato comes forward to affirm, his
      dogmas are altogether <i>&agrave; priori</i>: they enunciate
      preconceptions or hypotheses, which derive their hold upon his
      belief, not from any aptitude for solving the objections which he
      has raised, but from deep and solemn sentiment of some kind or
      other &#8212; religious, ethical, &aelig;sthetical, poetical, &amp;c.,
      the worship of numerical symmetry or exactness, &amp;c. The dogmas
      are enunciations of some grand sentiment of the divine, good,
      just, beautiful, symmetrical, &amp;c.,<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_99"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a> which
      Plato follows out into corollaries. But this is a process of
      itself; and while he is performing it, the doubts previously
      raised are not called up to be solved, but are forgotten or kept
      out of sight. It is therefore a mistake to suppose<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_100" href="#Footnotev1_8_100"><span
          class="sp">100</span></a> that Plato ties knots in one <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page401" id="v1page401"></a>401</span>
      dialogue only with a view to untie them in another; and that the
      doubts which he propounds are already fully solved in his own
      mind, only that he defers the announcement of the solution until
      the embarrassed hearer has struggled to find it for himself. </p>

        Dionysius of Halikarnassus remarks that the topics upon which
        Plato renounces the character of a searcher, and passes into
        that of a vehement affirmative dogmatist, are those which are
        above human investigation and evidence &#8212; the transcendental: &#954;&#945;&#8054;

      <p>M. Arago, in the following passage, points to a style of
        theorising in the physical sciences, very analogous to that of
        Plato, generally:&#8212; </p>
      <p>Arago, Biographies, vol. i. p. 149, Vie de Fresnel. &#8220;De ces
        deux explications des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de la
        lumi&egrave;re, l&#8217;une s&#8217;appelle la th&eacute;orie de
        l&#8217;&eacute;mission; l&#8217;autre est connue sous le nom de
        syst&egrave;me des ondes. On trouve d&eacute;j&agrave; des
        traces de la premi&egrave;re dans les &eacute;crits
        d&#8217;Emp&eacute;docle. Chez les modernes, je pourrais citer parmi
        ses adh&eacute;rents K&eacute;pler, Newton, Laplace. Le
        syst&egrave;me des ondes ne compte pas des partisans moins
        illustres: Aristote, Descartes, Hooke, Huygens, Euler, l&#8217;avaient

        je puis m&#8217;exprimer ainsi, de <i>simples v&eacute;rit&eacute;s

        Several of the Platonic critics speak as if they thought that
        Plato would never suggest any difficulty which he had not,
        beforehand and ready-made, the means of solving; and Munk treats
        the idea which I have stated in the text as ridiculous. &#8220;Plato
        (he observes) must have held preposterous doctrines on the
        subject of p&aelig;dagogy. He undertakes to instruct others by
        his writings, before he has yet cleared up his own ideas on the
        question, he proposes, in prop&aelig;deutic writings, enigmas
        for his scholars to solve, while he has not yet solved them
        himself; and all this for the praiseworthy (<i>ironically said</i>)
        purpose of correcting in their minds the false persuasion of
        knowledge.&#8221; (Die nat&uuml;rliche Ordnung der Platon Schrift. p.
        515.) </p>
      <p>That which Munk here derides, appears stated, again and again,
        by the Platonic Sokrates, as his real purpose. Munk is at
        liberty to treat it as ridiculous, but the ridicule falls upon
        Plato himself. The Platonic Sokrates disclaims the
        p&aelig;dagogic function, describing himself as nothing more
        than a fellow searcher with the rest. </p>
      <p>So too Munk declares (p. 79-80, and Zeller also, Philos. der
        Griech. vol. ii. p. 472, ed. 2nd) that Plato could not have
        composed the Parmenid&ecirc;s, including, as it does, such an
        assemblage of difficulties and objections against the theory of
        Ideas, until he possessed the means of solving all of them
        himself. This is a bold assertion, altogether conjectural; for
        there is no solution of them given in any of Plato&#8217;s writings,
        and the solutions to which Munk alludes as given by Zeller and
        Steinhart (even assuming them to be satisfactory, which I do not
        admit) travel much beyond the limits of Plato. </p>
      <p>Ueberweg maintains the same opinion (Ueber die Aechtheit der
        Platon. Schriften, p. 103-104); that Sokrates, in the Platonic
        Dialogues, though he appears as a Searcher, must nevertheless be
        looked upon as a matured thinker, who has already gone through
        the investigation for himself, and solved all the difficulties,
        but who goes back upon the work of search over again, for the
        instruction of the interlocutors. &#8220;The special talent and
        dexterity (Virtuosit&auml;t) which Sokrates displays in
        conducting the dialogue, can only be explained by supposing that
        he has already acquired for himself a firm and certain
        conviction on the question discussed.&#8221; </p>
      <p>This opinion of Ueberweg appears to me quite untenable, as well
        as inconsistent with a previous opinion which he had given
        elsewhere (Platonische Welt-seele, p. 69-70) &#8212; That the Platonic
        Ideenlehre was altogether insufficient for explanation. The
        impression which the Dialogues of Search make upon me is
        directly the reverse. My difficulty is, to understand how the
        constructor of all these puzzles, if he has the answer ready
        drawn up in his pocket, can avoid letting it slip out. At any
        rate, I stand upon the literal declarations, often repeated, of
        Sokrates; while Munk and Ueberweg contradict them. </p>
      <p>For the doubt and hesitation which Plato puts into the mouth of
        Sokrates (even in the Republic, one of his most expository
        compositions) see a remarkable passage, Rep. v. p. 450 E.

          id="Sidenotev1_8_54"></a>Hypothesis &#8212; that Plato had solved
        all his own difficulties for himself; but that he communicated
        the solution only to a few select auditors in oral lectures &#8212;
        Untenable.</span></p>
    <p>Some critics, assuming confidently that Plato must have produced
      a full breadth of positive philosophy to countervail his own
      negative fertility, yet not finding enough of it in the written
      dialogues look for it elsewhere. Tennemann thinks, and his opinion
      is partly shared by Boeckh and K. F. Hermann, that the direct,
      affirmative, and highest principles of Plato&#8217;s philosophy were
      enunciated only in his lectures: that the core, the central
      points, the great principles of his system (der Kern) were
      revealed thus orally to a few select students in plain and broad
      terms, while the dialogues were intentionally <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page402" id="v1page402"></a>402</span>written



      so as to convey only indirect hints, illustrations, applications
      of these great principles, together with refutation of various
      errors opposed to them: that Plato did not think it safe or
      prudent to make any full, direct, or systematic revelation to the
      general public.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_101" href="#Footnotev1_8_101"><span
          class="sp">101</span></a> I have already said that I think
      this opinion untenable. Among the few points which we know
      respecting the oral lectures, one is, that they were delivered not
      to a select and prepared few, but to a numerous and unprepared
      audience: while among the written dialogues, there are some which,
      far from being popular or adapted to an ordinary understanding,
      are highly perplexing and abstruse. The Tim&aelig;us does not
      confine itself to indirect hints, but delivers positive dogmas
      about the super-sensible world: though they are of a mystical
      cast, as we know that the oral lectures De Bono were also. </p>

        Plato&#8217;s Schriftsteller. Motive, pp. 290-294. </p>
      <p>Hermann considers this reserve and double doctrine to be
        unworthy of Plato, and ascribes it to Protagoras and other
        Sophists, on the authority of a passage in the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (152 C), which does not at all sustain his
        allegation.</p>
      <p>Hermann considers &#8220;die akroamatischen Lehren als Fortsetzung
        und Schlussstein der schriftlichen, die dort erst zur vollen
        Klarheit principieller Auffassung erhoben wurden, ohne jedoch
        &uuml;ber den n&auml;mlichen Gegenstand, soweit die Rede auf
        denselben kommen musste, etwas wesentlich Verschiedenes zu
        lehren&#8221; (p. 293).</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_55"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_55"></a>Characteristic of the oral lectures &#8212;
        that they were delivered in Plato&#8217;s own name. In what other
        respects they departed from the dialogues, we cannot say.</span></p>
    <p>Towards filling up this gap, then, the oral lectures cannot be
      shown to lend any assistance. The cardinal point of difference
      between them and the dialogues was, that they were delivered by
      Plato himself, in his own name; whereas he never published any
      written composition in his own name. But we do not know enough to
      say, in what particular way this difference would manifest itself.
      Besides the oral lectures, delivered to a numerous auditory, it is
      very probable that Plato held special communications upon
      philosophy with a few advanced pupils. Here however we are
      completely in the dark. Yet I see nothing, either in these
      supposed private communications or in the oral lectures, to
      controvert what was said in the last page &#8212; that Plato&#8217;s
      affirmative <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page403"
          id="v1page403"></a>403</span>philosophy is not fitted on to
      his negative philosophy, but grows out of other mental impulses,
      distinct and apart. Plato (as Aristotle tells us<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_8_102" href="#Footnotev1_8_102"><span
          class="sp">102</span></a>) felt it difficult to determine,
      whether the march of philosophy was an ascending one toward the <i>principia</i>
      (&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8048;&#962;), or a descending one down from the <i>principia</i>. A
      good philosophy ought to suffice for both, conjointly and
      alternately: in Plato&#8217;s philosophy, there is no road explicable
      either upwards or downwards, between the two: no justifiable mode
      of participation (&#956;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962;) between the two disparate worlds &#8212;
      intellect and sense. The <i>principia</i> of Plato take an
      impressive hold on the imagination: but they remove few or none of
      the Platonic difficulties; and they only seem to do this because
      the Sokratic Elenchus, so effective whenever it is applied, is
      never seriously brought to bear against them. </p>

      minds both of questioner and respondent are implicated and
      improved, each being indispensable to the other: he also
      represents it as a process, carried on under the immediate

      the result.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_106" href="#Footnotev1_8_106"><span

      but as an artistic piece of workmanship, whereby the taste and
      imagination are charmed. The dialogue was to him what the tragedy
      was to Sophokles, and the rhetorical discourse to Isokrates. He
      went on &#8220;combing and curling it&#8221; (to use the phrase of Dionysius)
      for as many years as Isokrates bestowed on the composition of the
      Panegyrical Oration. He handles the dialectic drama so as to
      exhibit some one among the many diverse ethical points of view,
      and to show what it involves as well as what it excludes in the
      way of consequence. We shall not find the ethical point of view
      always the same: there are material inconsistencies and
      differences in this respect between one dialogue and another. </p>

        As an illustration of that class of minds which take delight in
        the search for truth in different directions, I copy the
        following passage respecting Dr. Priestley, from an excellent
        modern scientific biography. &#8220;Dr. Priestley had seen so much of
        the evil of obstinate adherence to opinions which time had
        rendered decrepit, not venerable &#8212; and had been so richly
        rewarded in his capacity of natural philosopher, by his
        adventurous explorations of new territories in science &#8212; that he
        unavoidably and unconsciously over-estimated the value of what
        was novel, and held himself free to change his opinions to an
        extent not easily sympathised with by minds of a different
        order. Some men love to <i>rest</i> in truth, or at least in
        settled opinions, and are uneasy till they find repose. They
        alter their beliefs with great reluctance, and dread the charge
        of inconsistency, even in reference to trifling matters.
        Priestley, on the other hand, was a <i>follower after truth,
          who delighted in the chase, and was all his life long
          pursuing, not resting in it</i>. </p>
      <p>On all subjects which interested him he held by certain
        cardinal doctrines, but he left the outlines of his systems to
        be filled up as he gained experience, and to an extent very few
        men have done, disavowed any attempt to reconcile his changing
        views with each other, or to deprecate the charge of
        inconsistency.&#8230; I think it must be acknowledged by all who have
        studied his writings, that in his scientific researches at least
        he carried this feeling too far, and that often when he had
        reached a truth in which he might and should have rested, his
        dread of anything like a too hasty stereotyping of a supposed
        discovery, induced him to welcome whatever seemed to justify him
        in renewing the <i>pursuit</i> of truth, and thus led him
        completely astray. Priestley indeed missed many a discovery, the
        clue to which was in his hands and in his alone, by not knowing
        where to stop.&#8221; </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_8_57"></a>Plato has done more than any one else
        to make the process of enquiry interesting to others, as it was
        to himself.</span></p>
    <p>But amidst all these differences &#8212; and partly indeed by reason of
      these differences &#8212; Plato succeeds in inspiring his readers with
      much of the same interest in the process of dialectic enquiry
      which he evidently felt in his own bosom. The charm, with which he
      invests the process of philosophising, is one main cause of the
      preservation of his writings from the terrible ship-wreck which
      has overtaken so much of the abundant contemporary literature. It
      constitutes also one of his principle titles to the gratitude of
      intellectual men. This is a merit which may be claimed for Cicero
      also, but hardly for Aristotle, in so far as we can judge from the
      preserved portion of the Aristotelian writings: whether for the
      other <i>viri Socratici</i> his contemporaries, or in what
      proportion, we are unable to say. Plato&#8217;s works charmed and
      instructed all; so that they were <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page406" id="v1page406"></a>406</span>read not merely
      by disciples and admirers (as the Stoic and Epikurean treatises
      were), but by those who dissented from him as well as by those who
      agreed with him.<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_107"
        href="#Footnotev1_8_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a> The
      process of philosophising is one not naturally attractive except
      to a few minds: the more therefore do we owe to the colloquy of
      Sokrates and the writing of Plato, who handled it so as to diffuse
      the appetite for enquiry, and for sifting dissentient opinions.
      The stimulating and suggestive influence exercised by Plato &#8212; the
      variety of new roads pointed out to the free enquiring mind &#8212; are
      in themselves sufficiently valuable: whatever we may think of the
      positive results in which he himself acquiesced.<a

      <p>Cicero farther commends the Stoic Pan&aelig;tius for having
        relinquished the &#8220;tristitiam atque asperitatem&#8221; of his Stoic
        predecessors, Zeno, Chrysippus, &amp;c., and for endeavouring to
        reproduce the style and graces of Plato and Aristotle, whom he
        was always commending to his students (De Fin. iv. 28, 79).</p>

        The observation which Cicero applies to Varro, is applicable to
        the Platonic writings also. &#8220;Philosophiam multis locis <i>inchoasti</i>,
        ad impellendum satis, ad edocendum parum&#8221; (Academ. Poster. i. 3,
        9). </p>
      <p>I shall say more about this when I touch upon the Platonic <a
          href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40437/40437-h/40437-h.htm#Sidenotev3_34_14">Kleitophon</a>; an
        unfinished dialogue, which takes up the point of view here
        indicated by Cicero.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I have said thus much respecting what is common to the Dialogues
      of Search, because this is a species of composition now rare and
      strange. Modern readers do not understand what is meant by
      publishing an enquiry without any result &#8212; a story without an end.
      Respecting the Dialogues of Exposition, there is not the like
      difficulty. This is a species of composition, the purpose of which
      is generally understood. Whether the exposition be clear or
      obscure &#8212; orderly or confused &#8212; true or false &#8212; we shall see when
      we come to examine each separately. But these Dialogues of
      Exposition exhibit Plato in a different character: as the
      counterpart, not of Sokrates, but of Lykurgus (Republic and Leges)
      or of Pythagoras (in Tim&aelig;us).<a name="FnAnchorv1_8_109"

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_58"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_58"></a>Process of generalisation always kept
        in view and illustrated throughout the Platonic Dialogues of
        Search &#8212; general terms and propositions made subjects of
        conscious analysis.</span></p>
    <p>A farther remark which may be made, bearing upon most of the
      dialogues, relates to matter and not to manner. Everywhere (both
      in the Dialogues of Search and in those of exposition) the process
      of generalisation is kept in view and brought into conscious
      notice, directly or indirectly. The relation of the universal to
      its particulars, the contrast of the constant and essential with
      the variable and accidental, are turned <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page407" id="v1page407"></a>407</span>and returned in
      a thousand different ways. The principles of classification, with
      the breaking down of an extensive genus into species and
      sub-species, form the special subject of illustration in two of
      the most elaborate Platonic dialogues, and are often partially
      applied in the rest. To see the One in the Many, and the Many in
      the One, is represented as the great aim and characteristic
      attribute of the real philosopher. The testing of general terms,
      and of abstractions already embodied in familiar language, by
      interrogations applying them to many concrete and particular cases
      &#8212; is one manifestation of the Sokratic cross-examining process,
      which Plato multiplies and diversifies without limit. It is in his
      writings and in the conversation of Sokrates, that general terms
      and propositions first become the subject of conscious attention
      and analysis, and Plato was well aware that he was here opening
      the new road towards formal logic, unknown to his predecessors,
      unfamiliar even to his contemporaries. This process is indeed
      often overlaid in his writings by exuberant poetical imagery and
      by transcendental hypothesis: but the important fact is, that it
      was constantly present to his own mind and is impressed upon the
      notice of his readers. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_59"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_59"></a>The Dialogues must be reviewed as
        distinct compositions by the same author, illustrating each
        other, but without assignable inter-dependence.</span></p>
    <p>After these various remarks, having a common bearing upon all, or
      nearly all, the Platonic dialogues, I shall proceed to give some
      account of each dialogue separately. It is doubtless both
      practicable and useful to illustrate one of them by others,
      sometimes in the way of analogy, sometimes in that of contrast.
      But I shall not affect to handle them as contributories to one
      positive doctrinal system &#8212; nor as occupying each an intentional
      place in the gradual unfolding of one preconceived scheme &#8212; nor as
      successive manifestations of change, knowable and determinable, in
      the views of the author. For us they exist as distinct imaginary
      conversations, composed by the same author at unknown times and
      under unknown specialities of circumstance. Of course it is
      necessary to prefer some one order for reviewing the Dialogues,
      and for that purpose more or less of hypothesis must be admitted;
      but I shall endeavour to assume as little as possible. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_60"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_60"></a>Order of the Dialogues, chosen for
        bringing them under separate review. Apology will come first;
        Tim&aelig;us, Kritias, Leges, Epinomis last.</span></p>
    <p>The order which I shall adopt for considering the dialogues <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page408" id="v1page408"></a>408</span>coincides



      to a certain extent with that which some other expositors have
      adopted. It begins with those dialogues which delineate Sokrates,
      and which confine themselves to the subjects and points of view
      belonging to him, known as he is upon the independent testimony of
      Xenophon. First of all will come the Platonic Apology, containing
      the explicit negative programme of Sokrates, enunciated by himself
      a month before his death, when Plato was 28 years of age. </p>
    <p>Last of all, I shall take those dialogues which depart most
      widely from Sokrates, and which are believed to be the products of
      Plato&#8217;s most advanced age &#8212; Tim&aelig;us, Kritias, and Leges, with
      the sequel, Epinomis. These dialogues present a glaring contrast
      to the searching questions, the negative acuteness, the confessed
      ignorance, of Sokrates: Plato in his old age has not maintained
      consistency with his youth, as Sokrates did, but has passed round
      from the negative to the affirmative pole of philosophy. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_8_61"
          id="Sidenotev1_8_61"></a>Kriton and Euthyphron come
        immediately after Apology. The intermediate dialogues present no
        convincing grounds for any determinate order.</span></p>
    <p>Between the Apology and the dialogues named as last &#8212; I shall
      examine the intermediate dialogues according as they seem to
      approximate or recede from Sokrates and the negative dialectic.
      Here, however, the reasons for preference are noway satisfactory.
      Of the many dissentient schemes, professing to determine the real
      order in which the Platonic dialogues were composed, I find a
      certain plausibility in some, but no conclusive reason in any. Of
      course the reasons in favour of each one scheme, count against all
      the rest. I believe (as I have already said) that none of Plato&#8217;s
      dialogues were composed until after the death of Sokrates: but at
      what dates, or in what order, after that event, they were
      composed, it is impossible to determine. The Republic and
      Phil&ecirc;bus rank among the constructive dialogues, and may
      suitably be taken immediately before Tim&aelig;us: though the
      Republic belongs to the highest point of Plato&#8217;s genius, and
      includes a large measure of his negative acuteness combined with
      his most elaborate positive combinations. In the Sophist&ecirc;s
      and Politikus, Sokrates appears only in the character of a
      listener: in the Parmenid&ecirc;s also, the part assigned to him,
      instead of being aggressive and victorious, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page409" id="v1page409"></a>409</span>is subordinate
      to that of Parmenid&ecirc;s and confined to an unsuccessful
      defence. These dialogues, then, occupy a place late in the series.
      On the other hand, Kriton and Euthyphron have an immediate bearing
      upon the trial of Sokrates and the feelings connected with it. I
      shall take them in immediate sequel to the Apology. </p>
    <p>For the intermediate dialogues, the order is less marked and
      justifiable. In so far as a reason can be given, for preference as
      to former and later, I shall give it when the case arises. </p>

    <h2><a name="Platovol1ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. </h2>
    <h2>APOLOGY OF SOKRATES.</h2>
    <p>Adopting the order of precedence above described, for the review
      of the Platonic compositions, and taking the point of departure
      from Sokrates or the Sokratic point of view, I begin with the
      memorable composition called the Apology.</p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_9_1"
          id="Sidenotev1_9_1"></a> The Apology is the real defence
        delivered by Sokrates before the Dikasts, reported by Plato,
        without intentional transformation.</span></p>
    <p>I agree with Schleiermacher<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_1"
        href="#Footnotev1_9_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> &#8212; with the
      more recent investigations of Ueberweg &#8212; and with what (until
      recent times) seems to have been the common opinion, &#8212; that this
      is in substance the real defence pronounced by Sokrates; reported,
      and of course drest up, yet not intentionally transformed, by
      Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_2" href="#Footnotev1_9_2"><span
          class="sp">2</span></a> If such be the case, it is likely to
      have been put together shortly after the trial, and may thus be
      ranked among the earliest of the Platonic compositions: for I have
      already intimated my belief that Plato composed no <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page411" id="v1page411"></a>411</span>dialogues



      under the name of Sokrates, during the lifetime of Sokrates. </p>

        Zeller is of opinion that the Apology, as well as the Kriton,
        were put together at Megara by Plato, shortly after the death of
        Sokrates. (Zeller, De Hermodoro Ephesio, p. 19.) </p>
      <p>Schleiermacher, Einl. zur Apologie, vol. ii. pp. 182-185.
        Ueberweg, Ueber die Aechtheit der Plat. Schrift. p. 246. </p>
      <p>Steinhart thinks (Einleitung, pp. 236-238) that the Apology
        contains more of Plato, and less of Sokrates: but he does not
        make his view very clear to me. Ast, on the contrary, treats the
        Apology as spurious and unworthy of Plato. (Ueber Platon&#8217;s Leben
        und Schriften, p. 477, seq.) His arguments are rather objections
        against the merits of the composition, than reasons for
        believing it not to be the work of Plato. I dissent from them
        entirely: but they show that an acute critic can make out a
        plausible case, satisfactory to himself, against any dialogue.
        If it be once conceded that the question of genuine or spurious
        is to be tried upon such purely internal grounds of critical
        admiration and complete harmony of sentiment, Ast might have
        made out a case even stronger against the genuineness of the
        Ph&aelig;drus, Symposion, Phil&ecirc;bus, Parmenid&ecirc;s.</p>

        See chapter lxviii. of my History of Greece. </p>
      <p>The reader will find in that chapter a full narrative of all
        the circumstances known to us respecting both the life and the
        condemnation of Sokrates. </p>
      <p>A very admirable account may also be seen of the character of
        Sokrates, and his position with reference to the Athenian
        people, in the article entitled <i>Sokrates und Sein Volk</i>,
        Akademischer Vortrag, by Professor Hermann K&ouml;chly; a
        lecture delivered at Zurich in 1855, and published with
        enlargements in 1859.</p>
      <p>Professor K&ouml;chly&#8217;s article (contained in a volume entitled
        <i>Akademische Vortr&auml;ge</i>, Zurich, 1859) is eminently
        deserving of perusal. It not only contains a careful summary of
        the contemporary history, so far as Sokrates is concerned, but
        it has farther the great merit of fairly estimating that
        illustrious man in reference to the actual feeling of the time,
        and to the real public among whom he moved. I feel much
        satisfaction in seeing that Professor K&ouml;chly&#8217;s picture,
        composed without any knowledge of my History of Greece, presents
        substantially the same view of Sokrates and his contemporaries
        as that which is taken in my sixty-eighth chapter. </p>
      <p>K&ouml;chly considers that the Platonic Apology preserves the
        Sokratic character more faithfully than any of Plato&#8217;s writings;
        and that it represents what Sokrates said, as nearly as the
        &#8220;dichterische Natur&#8221; of Plato would permit (K&ouml;chly, pp.
        302-364.) </p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_9_2"
          id="Sidenotev1_9_2"></a>Even if it be Plato&#8217;s own composition,
        it comes naturally first in the review of his dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>Such, in my judgment, is the most probable hypothesis respecting
      the Apology. But even if we discard this hypothesis; if we treat
      the Apology as a pure product of the Platonic imagination (like
      the dialogues), and therefore not necessarily connected in point
      of time with the event to which it refers &#8212; still there are good
      reasons for putting it first in the order of review. For it would
      then be Plato&#8217;s own exposition, given more explicitly and solemnly
      than anywhere else, of the Sokratic point of view and
      life-purpose. It would be an exposition embodying that union of
      generalising impulse, mistrust of established common-places, and
      aggressive cross-examining ardour &#8212; with eccentric religious
      persuasion, as well as with perpetual immersion in the crowd of
      the pal&aelig;stra and the market-place: which immersion was not
      less indispensable to Sokrates than repugnant to the feelings of
      Plato himself. An exposition, lastly, disavowing all that taste
      for cosmical speculation, and that transcendental dogmatism, which
      formed one among the leading features of Plato as distinguished
      from Sokrates. In whichever way we look at the Apology, whether as
      a real or as an imaginary defence, it contains more of pure
      Sokratism than any other composition of Plato, and as such will
      occupy the first place in the arrangement which I adopt.<a

        Dionysius Hal. regards the Apology, not as a report of what
        Sokrates really said, nor as approximating thereunto, but as a
        pure composition of Plato himself, for three purposes
        combined:&#8212;1. To defend and extol Sokrates. 2. To accuse the
        Athenian public and Dikasts. 3. To furnish a picture of what a
        philosopher ought to be. &#8212; All these purposes are to a certain
        extent included and merged in a fourth, which I hold to be the
        true one, &#8212; to exhibit what Sokrates was and had been, in
        relation to the Athenian public. </p>
      <p>The comparison drawn by Dionysius between the Apology and the
        oration De Coron&acirc; of Demosthenes, appears to me
        unsuitable. The two are altogether disparate, in spirit, in
        purpose, and in execution. (See Dion. H. Ars Rhet. pp. 295-298:

      discourse as it concerns the relations between Sokrates himself
      and the Dikasts to whom he addressed it. I here regard it only as
      it concerns Plato; and as it forms a convenient point of departure
      for entering upon and appreciating the Platonic dialogues. </p>

        Sentiments entertained towards Sokrates at Athens.</span></p>
    <p>The Apology of Sokrates is not a dialogue but a continuous
      discourse addressed to the Dikasts, containing nevertheless a few
      questions and answers interchanged between him and the accuser
      Mel&ecirc;tus in open court. It is occupied, partly, in rebutting
      the counts of the indictment (<i>viz.</i>, 1. That Sokrates did
      not believe in the Gods or in the D&aelig;mons generally
      recognised by his countrymen: 2. That he was a corruptor of youth<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_4" href="#Footnotev1_9_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>)
      &#8212; partly in setting forth those proceedings of his life out of
      which such charges had grown, and by which he had become obnoxious
      to a wide-spread feeling of personal hatred. By his companions, by
      those who best knew him, and by a considerable number of ardent
      young men, he was greatly esteemed and admired: by the general
      public, too, his acuteness as well as his self-sufficing and
      independent character, were appreciated with a certain respect.
      Yet he was at the same time disliked, as an aggressive disputant
      who &#8220;tilted at all he met&#8221; &#8212; who raised questions novel as well as
      perplexing, who pretended to special intimations from the Gods &#8212;
      and whose views no one could distinctly make out.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_5" href="#Footnotev1_9_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
      By the eminent citizens of all varieties &#8212; politicians, rhetors,
      Sophists, tragic and comic poets, artisans, &amp;c. &#8212; he had made
      himself both hated and feared.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_6"
        href="#Footnotev1_9_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> He empha<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page413" id="v1page413"></a>413</span>tically



      denies the accusation of general disbelief in the Gods, advanced
      by Mel&ecirc;tus: and he affirms generally (though less
      distinctly) that the Gods in whom he believed, were just the same
      as those in whom the whole city believed. Especially does he
      repudiate the idea, that he could be so absurd as to doubt the
      divinity of Helios and Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc;, in which all the world
      believed;<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_7" href="#Footnotev1_9_7"><span
          class="sp">7</span></a> and to adopt the heresy of Anaxagoras,
      who degraded these Divinities into physical masses. Respecting his
      general creed, he thus puts himself within the pale of Athenian
      orthodoxy. He even invokes that very sentiment (with some doubt
      whether the Dikasts will believe him<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_8"
        href="#Footnotev1_9_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>) for the
      justification of the obnoxious and obtrusive peculiarities of his
      life; representing himself as having acted under the mission of
      the Delphian God, expressly transmitted from the oracle. </p>

        respecting the wisdom of Sokrates, interpreted by him as a
        mission to cross-examine the citizens generally &#8212; The oracle is
        proved to be true.</span></p>
    <p>According to his statement, his friend and earnest admirer
      Ch&aelig;rephon, had asked the question at the oracle of Delphi,
      whether any one was wiser than Sokrates? The reply of the oracle
      declared, that no one was wiser. On hearing this declaration from
      an infallible authority, Sokrates was greatly perplexed: for he
      was conscious to himself of not being wise upon any matter, great
      or small.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_9" href="#Footnotev1_9_9"><span
          class="sp">9</span></a> He at length concluded that the
      declaration of the oracle could be proved true, only on the
      hypothesis that other persons were less wise than they seemed to
      be or fancied themselves. To verify this hypothesis, he proceeded
      to cross-examine the most eminent persons in many different walks
      &#8212; political men, rhetors, Sophists, poets, artisans. On applying
      his Elenchus, and putting to them testing interrogations, he found
      them all without exception destitute of any real wisdom, yet fully
      persuaded that they <i>were</i> wise, and incapable of being
      shaken in that persuasion. The artisans indeed did <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page414" id="v1page414"></a>414</span>really



      know each his own special trade; but then, on account of this
      knowledge, they believed themselves to be wise on other great
      matters also. So also the poets were great in their own
      compositions; but on being questioned respecting these very
      compositions, they were unable to give any rational or consistent
      explanations: so that they plainly appeared to have written
      beautiful verses, not from any wisdom of their own, but through
      inspiration from the Gods, or spontaneous promptings of nature.
      The result was, that these men were all proved to possess no more
      real wisdom than Sokrates: but <i>he</i> was aware of his own
      deficiency; while <i>they</i> were fully convinced of their own
      wisdom, and could not be made sensible of the contrary. In this
      way Sokrates justified the certificate of superiority vouchsafed
      to him by the oracle. He, like all other persons, was destitute of
      wisdom; but he was the only one who knew, or could be made to
      feel, his own real mental condition. With others, and most of all
      with the most conspicuous men, the false persuasion of their own
      wisdom was universal and inexpugnable.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_10"

    <p>This then was the philosophical mission of Sokrates, imposed upon
      him by the Delphian oracle, and in which he passed the mature
      portion of his life: to cross-examine every one, to expose that
      false persuasion of knowledge which every one felt, and to
      demonstrate the truth of that which the oracle really meant by

      life and strength, to exhort and interrogate in my usual strain,
      telling every one whom I meet<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_15"
        href="#Footnotev1_9_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> &#8212; You, a
      citizen of the great and intelligent Athens, are you not ashamed
      of busying yourself to procure wealth, reputation, and glory, in
      the greatest possible quantity; while you take neither thought nor
      pains about truth, or wisdom, or the fullest measure of goodness
      for your mind? If any one denies the charge, and professes that he
      <i>does</i> take thought for these objects, &#8212; I shall not let him
      off without questioning, cross-examining, and exposing him.<a

      And if he appears to me to affirm that he is virtuous without
      being so in reality, I shall reproach him for caring least about
      the greater matter, and most about the smaller. This course I
      shall pursue with every one whom I meet, young or old, citizen or
      non-citizen: most of all with you citizens, because you are most
      nearly connected with me. For this, you know, is what the God
      commands, and I think that no greater blessing has ever happened
      to the city than this ministration of mine under orders from the
      God. For I go about incessantly persuading you all, old as well as
      young, not to care about your bodies, or about riches, so much as
      about acquiring the largest measure of virtue for your minds. I
      urge upon you that virtue is not the fruit of wealth, but that
      wealth, together with all the other things good for mankind
      publicly and privately, are the fruits of virtue.<a

      If I am a corruptor of youth, it is by these discourses that I
      corrupt them: and if any one gives a different version of my
      discourses, he talks idly. Accordingly, men of Athens, I must tell
      you plainly: decide with Anytus, or not, &#8212; acquit me or not &#8212; I
      shall do nothing different from what I have done, even if I am to
      die many times over for it.&#8221; </p>

    <p>Such is the description given by Sokrates of his own profession
      and standing purpose, imposed upon him as a duty by the Delphian
      God. He neglected all labour either for profit, or for political
      importance, or for the public service; he devoted himself, from
      morning till night, to the task of stirring up the Athenian
      public, as the gadfly worries a large and high-bred but over-sleek
      horse:<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_18" href="#Footnotev1_9_18"><span

      persuasion, reproach, to render account of their lives and to seek

      celebrity, would arise in numbers,<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_20"

    <p>While Sokrates thus extols, and sanctifies under the authority of
      the Delphian God, his habitual occupation of interrogating,
      cross-examining, and stimulating to virtue, the Athenians
      indiscriminately &#8212; he disclaims altogether the function of a
      teacher. His disclaimer on this point is unequivocal and emphatic.
      He cannot teach others, because he is not at all wiser than they.
      He is fully aware that he is not wise on any point, great or small
      &#8212; that he knows nothing at all, so to speak.<a

      He can convict others, by their own answers, of real though
      unconscious ignorance, or <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page417" id="v1page417"></a>417</span>(under another
      name) false persuasion of knowledge: and because he can do so, he
      is presumed to possess positive knowledge on the points to which
      the exposure refers. But this presumption is altogether unfounded:
      he possesses no such positive knowledge. Wisdom is not to be found
      in any man, even among the most distinguished: Sokrates is as
      ignorant as others; and his only point of superiority is, that he
      is fully conscious of his own ignorance, while others, far from
      having the like consciousness, confidently believe themselves to
      be in possession of wisdom and truth.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_22"

      and virtue which is so widely diffused among them. 2. To reproach

    <p>Such is the substance of the Platonic Apology of Sokrates. How
      strong was the impression which it made, on many philosophical
      readers, we may judge from the fact, that Zeno, the founder of the
      Stoic school, being a native of Kition in Cyprus, derived from the
      perusal of the Apology his first inducement to come over to
      Athens, and devote himself to the study and teaching of philosophy
      in that city.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_28" href="#Footnotev1_9_28"><span
          class="sp">28</span></a> Sokrates depicts, with fearless

      them. With equal sincerity does he declare the limits within which

      <p>This statement deserves full belief: it probably came from Zeno
        himself, a voluminous writer. The father of Zeno was a merchant
        who traded with Athens, and brought back books for his son to
        read, Sokratic books among them. Diogen. Laert. vii. 31.</p>
      <p>Respecting another statement made by Themistius in the same
        page, I do not feel so certain. He says that the accusatory
        discourse pronounced against Sokrates by Anytus was composed by
        Polykrates, as a &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962;, and paid for. This may be the fact
        but the words of Isokrates in the Busiris rather lead me to the
        belief that the &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; composed by Polykrates was a
        sophistical exercise, composed to acquire reputation and pupils,
        not a discourse really delivered in the Dikastery.</p>

    <p>But neither of his two most eminent companions can endure to
      restrict his competence within such narrow limits. Xenophon<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_29" href="#Footnotev1_9_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
      affirms that Sokrates was assiduous in communicating useful
      instruction and positive edification to his hearers. Plato
      sometimes, though more rarely, intimates the same: but for the
      most part, and in the Dialogues of Search throughout, he keeps <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page419" id="v1page419"></a>419</span>Sokrates



      within the circle of procedure which the Apology claims for him.
      These dialogues exemplify in detail the aggressive operations,
      announced therein by Sokrates in general terms as his missionary
      life-purpose, against contemporaries of note, very different from
      each other &#8212; against aspiring youths, statesmen, generals,
      Rhetors, Sophists, orthodox pietists, poets, rhapsodes, &amp;c.
      Sokrates cross-examines them all, and convicts them of humiliating
      ignorance: but he does not furnish, nor does he profess to be able
      to furnish, any solution of his own difficulties. Many of the
      persons cross-examined bear historical names: but I think it
      necessary to warn the reader, that all of them speak both language
      and sentiments provided for them by Plato, and not their own.<a

        It might seem superfluous to give such a warning; but many
        commentators speak as if they required it. They denounce the
        Platonic speakers in harsh terms, which have no pertinence,
        unless supposed to be applied to a real man expressing his own
        thoughts and feelings.</p>
      <p>It is useless to enjoin us, as Stallbaum and Steinhart do, to
        mark the aristocratical conceit of Menon! &#8212; the pompous
        ostentation and pretensive verbosity of Protagoras and Gorgias!
        &#8212; the exorbitant selfishness of Polus and Kallikl&ecirc;s! &#8212; the
        impudent brutality of Thrasymachus! &#8212; when all these persons
        speak entirely under the prompting of Plato himself.</p>
      <p>You might just as well judge of Sokrates by what we read in the
        Nubes of Aristophanes, or of Meton by what we find in the Aves,
        as describe the historical characters of the above-named
        personages out of the Platonic dialogues. They ought to be
        appreciated as dramatic pictures, drest up by the author for his
        own purpose, and delivering such opinions as he assigns to them
        &#8212; whether he intends them to be refuted by others, or not.</p>

        Sokrates is a positive teacher, employing indirect methods for
        the inculcation of theories of his own.</span></p>
    <p>The disclaimer, so often repeated by Sokrates, &#8212; that he
      possessed neither positive knowledge nor wisdom in his own person,
      &#8212; was frequently treated by his contemporaries as ironical. He was
      not supposed to be in earnest when he made it. Every one presumed
      that he must himself know that which he proved others not to know,
      whatever motive he might have for affecting ignorance.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_31" href="#Footnotev1_9_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a>
      His personal manner and homely vein of illustration seemed to
      favour the supposition that he was bantering. This interpreta<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page420" id="v1page420"></a>420</span>tion



      of the character of Sokrates appears in the main to be preferred
      by modern critics. Of course (they imagine) an able man who
      cross-questions others on the definitions of Law, Justice,
      Democracy, &amp;c., has already meditated on the subject, and
      framed for himself unimpeachable definitions of these terms.
      Sokrates (they suppose) is a positive teacher and theorist,
      employing a method, which, though indirect and circuitous, is
      nevertheless calculated deliberately beforehand for the purpose of
      introducing and inculcating premeditated doctrines of his own.
      Pursuant to this hypothesis, it is presumed that the positive
      theory of Sokrates is to be found in his negative
      cross-examinations, &#8212; not indeed set down clearly in any one
      sentence, so that he who runs may read &#8212; yet disseminated in
      separate syllables or letters, which may be distinguished, picked
      out, and put together into propositions, by an acute detective
      examiner. And the same presumption is usually applied to the
      Sokrates of the Platonic dialogues: that is, to Plato employing
      Sokrates as spokesman. Interpreters sift with microscopic accuracy
      the negative dialogues of Plato, in hopes of detecting the
      ultimate elements of that positive solution which he is supposed
      to have lodged therein, and which, when found, may be put together
      so as to clear up all the antecedent difficulties. </p>

      <p>Aristeides the Rhetor furnishes a valuable confirmation of the
        truth of that picture of Sokrates, which we find in the Platonic
        Apology. All the other companions of Sokrates who wrote
        dialogues about him (not preserved to us), presented the same

        the Sokratic Elenchus does not furnish a solution, but works
        upon the mind of the respondent, stimulating him to seek for a
        solution of his own.</span></p>
    <p>I have already said (in the preceding <a href="#Sidenotev1_8_40">chapter</a>)
      that I cannot take this view either of Sokrates or of Plato.
      Without doubt, each of them had affirmative doctrines and
      convictions, though not both the same. But the affirmative vein,
      with both of them, runs in a channel completely distinct from the
      negative. The affirmative theory has its roots <i>aliunde</i>,
      and is neither generated, nor adapted, with a view to reconcile
      the contradictions, or elucidate the obscurities, which the
      negative Elenchus has exposed. That exposure does indeed render
      the embarrassed respondent painfully conscious of the want of some
      rational, consistent, and adequate theoretical explanation: it
      farther stimulates him to make efforts of his own for the supply
      of that want. But such efforts must be really his own; the
      Elenchus gives no farther help: it furnishes problems, but no
      solutions, nor even any assurance that the problems as presented,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page421" id="v1page421"></a>421</span>admit



      of affirmative solutions. Whoever expects that such consummate
      masters of the negative process as Sokrates and Plato, when they
      come to deliver affirmative dogmas of their own, will be kept
      under restraint by their own previous Elenchus, and will take care
      that their dogmas shall not be vulnerable by the same weapons as
      they had employed against others &#8212; will be disappointed. They do
      not employ any negative test against themselves. When Sokrates
      preaches in the Xenophontic Memorabilia, or the Athenian Stranger
      in the Platonic Leges, they jump over, or suppose to be already
      solved, the difficulties under the pressure of which other
      disputants had been previously discredited: they assume all the
      undefinable common-places to be clearly understood, and all the
      inconsistent generalities to be brought into harmony. Thus it is
      that the negative cross-examination, and the affirmative
      dogmatism, are (both in Sokrates and in Plato) two unconnected
      operations of thought: the one does not lead to, or involve, or
      verify, the other. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_9_14"
          id="Sidenotev1_9_14"></a>Value and importance of this process
        &#8212; stimulating active individual minds to theorise each for
        itself.</span></p>
    <p>Those who depreciate the negative process simply, unless followed
      up by some new positive doctrine which shall be proof against all
      such attack &#8212; cannot be expected to admire Sokrates greatly, even
      as he stands rated by himself. Even if I concurred in this
      opinion, I should still think myself obliged to exhibit him as he
      really was. But I do not concur in the opinion. I think that the
      creation and furtherance of individual, self-thinking minds, each
      instigated to form some rational and consistent theory for itself,
      is a material benefit, even though no farther aid be rendered to
      the process except in the way of negative suggestion. That such
      minds should be made to feel the arbitrary and incoherent
      character of that which they have imbibed by passive association
      as ethics and &aelig;sthetics, &#8212; and that they should endeavour to
      test it by some rational and consistent standard &#8212; would be an
      improving process, though no one theory could be framed
      satisfactory to all. The Sokratic Elenchus went directly to this
      result. Plato followed in the same track, not of pouring new
      matter of knowledge into the pupil, but of eliciting new thoughts
      and beliefs out of him, by kindling the latent forces of his
      intellect. A large proportion of Plato&#8217;s dialogues have no other
      purpose or <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page422"
          id="v1page422"></a>422</span>value. And in entering upon the
      consideration of these dialogues, we cannot take a better point of
      departure than the Apology of Sokrates, wherein the speaker, alike
      honest and decided in his convictions, at the close of a long
      cross-examining career, re-asserts expressly his devoted
      allegiance to the negative process, and disclaims with equal
      emphasis all power over the affirmative. </p>

        Other men profess to know what it is, and think it a great
        misfortune: he does not know.</span> </p>
    <p>In that touching discourse, the Universal Cross-Examiner declares
      a thorough resolution to follow his own individual conviction and
      his own sense of duty &#8212; whether agreeing or disagreeing with the
      convictions of his countrymen, and whether leading to danger or to
      death for himself. &#8220;Where a man may have posted himself either &#8212;
      under his own belief that it is best, or under orders from the
      magistrate &#8212; there he must stay and affront danger, not caring for
      death or anything else in comparison with disgrace.&#8221;<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_32" href="#Footnotev1_9_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
      As to death, Sokrates knows very little what it is, nor whether it
      is good or evil. The fear of death, in his view, is only one case
      of the prevalent mental malady &#8212; men believing themselves to know
      that of which they really know nothing. If death be an extinction
      of all sensation, like a perpetual and dreamless sleep, he will
      regard it as a prodigious benefit compared with life: even the
      Great King will not be a loser by the exchange.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_33" href="#Footnotev1_9_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
      If on the contrary death be a transition into Hades, to keep
      company with those who have died before &#8212; Homer, Hesiod, the
      heroes of the Trojan war, &amp;c. &#8212; Sokrates will consider it
      supreme happiness to converse with and cross-examine the
      potentates and clever men <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page423" id="v1page423"></a>423</span>of the past &#8212;
      Agamemnon, Odysseus, Sisyphus; thus discriminating which of them
      are really wise, and which of them are only unconscious
      pretenders. He is convinced that no evil can ever happen to the
      good man; that the protection, of the Gods can never be wanting to
      him, whether alive or dead.<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_34"
        href="#Footnotev1_9_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> &#8220;It is
      not lawful for a better man to be injured by a worse. He may
      indeed be killed, or banished, or disfranchised; and these may
      appear great evils, in the eye of others. But I do not think them
      so. It is a far greater evil to do what Mel&ecirc;tus is now doing
      &#8212; trying to kill a man unjustly.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_9_35"

      <p>Ast remarks (Plat. Leb. und Schrift. p. 488) that the language
        of doubt and uncertainty in which Sokrates here speaks of the
        consequences of death, is greatly at variance with the language
        which he is made to hold in Ph&aelig;don. Ast adduces this as
        one of his arguments for disallowing the authenticity of the
        Apology. I do not admit the inference. I am prepared for
        divergence between the opinions of Sokrates in different
        dialogues; and I believe, moreover, that the Sokrates of the
        Ph&aelig;don is spokesman chosen to argue in support of the main
        thesis of that dialogue. But it is impossible to deny the
        variance which Ast points out, and which is also admitted by
        Stallbaum. Steinhart indeed (Einleitung, p. 246) goes the length
        of denying it, in which I cannot follow him. The sentiment of
        Sokrates in the Apology embodies the same alternative
        uncertainty, as what we read in Marcus Antoninus, v. 33. &#932;&#943; &#959;&#8022;&#957;;

    <p>Sokrates here gives his own estimate of comparative good and
      evil. Death, banishment, disfranchisement, &amp;c., are no great
      evils: to put another man to death unjustly, is a great evil to
      the doer: the good man can suffer no evil at all. These are given
      as the judgments of Sokrates, and as dissentient from most others.
      Whether they are Sokratic or Platonic opinions, or common to both
      &#8212; we shall find them reappearing in various other Platonic
      dialogues, hereafter to be noticed. We have also to notice that
      marked feature in the character of Sokrates<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_9_36" href="#Footnotev1_9_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
      &#8212; the standing upon his own individual reason and measure of good
      and evil: nay, even pushing his confidence in it so far, as to
      believe in a divine voice informing and moving him. This reliance
      on the individual reason is sometimes recognised, at other times
      rejected, in the Platonic dialogues. Plato rejects <span

      in his comments (contained in the dialogue The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus)
      on the doctrine of Protagoras: he rejects it also in the
      constructive dialogues, Republic and Leges, where he constitutes
      himself despotic legislator, prescribing a standard of orthodox
      opinion; he proclaims it in the Gorgias, and implies it very
      generally throughout the negative dialogues. </p>

    <p>It is against this ancient, established belief, passing for
      knowledge &#8212; communicated by unconscious contagion without any
      rational process &#8212; against the &#8220;<a href="#Footnotev1_P_1">proc&egrave;s

    <p>The dialogue called Kriton is, in one point of view, a second
      part or sequel &#8212; in another point of view, an antithesis or
      corrective &#8212; of the Platonic Apology. For that reason, I notice it
      immediately after the Apology: though I do not venture to affirm
      confidently that it was composed immediately after: it may
      possibly have been later, as I believe the Ph&aelig;don also to
      have been later.<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_1" href="#Footnotev1_10_1"><span

        Steinhart affirms with confidence that the Kriton was composed
        immediately after the Apology, and shortly after the death of
        Sokrates (Einleitung, p. 303). The fact may be so, but I do not
        feel thus confident of it when I look to the analogy of the
        later Ph&aelig;don. </p>

        interlocutors.</span></p>
    <p>The Kriton describes a conversation between Sokrates and his
      friend Kriton in the prison, after condemnation, and two days
      before the cup of hemlock was administered. Kriton entreats and
      urges Sokrates (as the sympathising friends had probably done
      frequently during the thirty days of imprisonment) to make his
      escape from the prison, informing him that arrangements have
      already been made for enabling him to escape with ease and safety,
      and that money as well as good recommendations will be provided,
      so that he may dwell comfortably either in Thessaly, or wherever
      else he pleases. Sokrates ought not, in justice to his children
      and his friends, to refuse the opportunity offered, and thus to
      throw away his life. Should he do so, it will appear to every one
      as if his friends had shamefully failed in their duty, when
      intervention on their part might easily have saved him. He might
      have avoided the trial altogether: even when on trial, he might
      easily <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page426" id="v1page426"></a>426</span>have



      escaped the capital sentence. Here is now a third opportunity of
      rescue, which if he declines, it will turn this grave and painful
      affair into mockery, as if he and his friends were impotent
      simpletons.<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_2" href="#Footnotev1_10_2"><span
          class="sp">2</span></a> Besides the mournful character of the
      event, Sokrates and his friends will thus be disgraced in the
      opinion of every one. </p>

      <p>This is a remarkable passage, as evincing both the trial and
        the death of Sokrates, even in the opinion of his own friends,
        might have been avoided without anything which they conceived
        dishonourable to his character.</p>
      <p>Professor K&ouml;chly puts this point very forcibly in his <i>Vortrag</i>,

    <p>&#8220;Disgraced in the opinion of every one,&#8221; replies Sokrates? That
      is not the proper test by which the propriety of your
      recommendation must be determined. I am now, as I always have
      been, prepared to follow nothing but that voice of reason which
      approves itself to me in discussion as the best and soundest.<a

      We have often discussed this matter before, and the conclusions on
      which we agreed are not to be thrown aside because of my impending
      death. We agreed that the opinions general among men ought not to
      be followed in all cases, but only in some: that the good
      opinions, those of the wise men, were to be followed &#8212; the bad
      opinions, those of the foolish men, to be disregarded. In the
      treatment and exercise of the body, we must not attend to the
      praise, the blame, or the opinion of every man, but only to those
      of the one professional trainer or physician. If we disregard this
      one skilful man, and conduct ourselves according to the praise or
      blame of the unskilful public, our body will become corrupted and
      disabled, so that life itself will not be worth having. </p>

    <p>Sokrates thus proceeds:&mdash; </p>
    <p>The point to be decided, therefore, with reference to your
      proposition, Kriton, is, not what will be generally said if I
      decline, but whether it will be just or unjust &#8212; right or wrong &#8212;
      if I comply; that is, if I consent to escape from prison against
      the will of the Athenians and against the sentence of law. </p>

    <p>To decide the point, I assume this principle, which we have often

    <p>We ought not in any case whatever to act wrong or unjustly. To
      act so is in every case both bad for the agent and dishonourable
      to the agent, whatever may be its consequences. Even though others
      act wrong to us, we ought not to act wrong to them in return. Even

        the Laws of Athens to Sokrates, demanding from him implicit
        obedience.</span></p>
    <p>Sokrates then delivers a well-known and eloquent pleading,
      wherein he imagines the Laws of Athens to remonstrate with him on
      his purpose of secretly quitting the prison, in order to evade a
      sentence legally pronounced. By his birth, and long residence in
      Athens, he has entered into a covenant to obey exactly and
      faithfully what the laws prescribe. Though the laws should deal
      unjustly with him, he has no right of redress against them &#8212;
      neither by open disobedience, nor force, nor evasion. Their rights
      over him are even more uncontrolled and indefeasible than those of
      his father and mother. The laws allow to every citizen full
      liberty of trying to persuade the assembled public: but the
      citizen who fails in persuading, must obey the public when they
      enact a law adverse to his views. Sokrates having been
      distinguished beyond all others for the constancy of his residence
      at Athens, has thus shown that he was well satisfied with the
      city, and with those laws without which it could not exist as a
      city. If he now violates his covenants and his duty, by breaking
      prison like a runaway slave, he will forfeit all the reputation to
      which he has pretended during his long life, as a preacher of
      justice and virtue.<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_9"

        to present the dispositions of Sokrates in a light different
        from that which the Apology had presented &#8212; unqualified
        submission instead of defiance.</span></p>
    <p>This striking discourse, the general drift of which I have
      briefly described, appears intended by Plato &#8212; as far as I can
      pretend to guess at his purpose &#8212; to set forth the personal
      character and dispositions of Sokrates in a light different from
      that which they present in the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page429" id="v1page429"></a>429</span>Apology. In
      defending himself before the Dikasts, Sokrates had exalted himself
      into a position which would undoubtedly be construed by his
      auditors as disobedience and defiance to the city and its
      institutions. He professed to be acting under a divine mission,
      which was of higher authority than the enactments of his
      countrymen: he warned them against condemning him, because his
      condemnation would be a mischief, not to him, but to them and
      because by doing so they would repudiate and maltreat the
      missionary sent to them by the Delphian God as a valuable present.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_10_10" href="#Footnotev1_10_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> In the judgment of the Athenian
      Dikasts, Sokrates by using such language had put himself above the
      laws; thus confirming the charge which his accusers advanced, and
      which they justified by some of his public remarks. He had
      manifested by unmistakable language the same contempt for the
      Athenian constitution as that which had been displayed in act by
      Kritias and Alkibiades,<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_11"

      recognises this impression as prevalent among his countrymen
      against Sokrates, and provides what he thinks a suitable answer to
      it. Plato also has his way of answering it; and such I imagine to
      be the dramatic purpose of the Kriton. </p>

        This was among the charges urged against Sokrates by Anytus and
        the other accusers (Xen. Mem. i. 2, 9. &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#961;&#8119;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

        respecting Sokrates by the Roman censor, the elder Cato; a man
        very much like the Athenian Anytus, constitutional and patriotic
        as a citizen, devoted to the active duties of political life,
        but thoroughly averse to philosophy and speculative debate, as
        Anytus is depicted in the Menon of Plato. &#8212; Plutarch, Cato c.
        23, a passage already cited in a <a href="#Footnotev1_8_86">note</a>

      <p>The accusation of &#8220;putting himself above the laws,&#8221; appears in
        the same way in the Nubes of Aristophanes, 1035-1400, &amp;c.:&#8212;</p>

        The dramatic position of Sokrates has been compared by
        K&ouml;chly, p. 382, very suitably with that of Antigon&eacute;,
        who, in burying her deceased brother, acts upon her own sense of
        right and family affections, in defiance of an express interdict
        from sovereign authority. This tragical conflict of obligations,
        indicated by Aristotle as an ethical question suited for
        dialectic debate (Topic. i. p. 105, b. 22), was handled by all
        the three great tragedians; and has been ennobled by Sophokles
        in one of his best remaining tragedies. The Platonic Apology
        presents many points of analogy with the Antigon&eacute;, while
        the Platonic Kriton carries us into an opposite vein of
        sentiment. Sokrates after sentence, and Antigon&eacute; after
        sentence, are totally different persons. The young maiden,
        though adhering with unshaken conviction to the rectitude of her
        past disobedience, cannot submit to the sentence of death
        without complaint and protestation. Though above all fear she is
        clamorous in remonstrances against both the injustice of the
        sentence and the untimely close of her career: so that she is
        obliged to be dragged away by the officers (Soph. Antig.
        870-877; compare 497-508, with Plato, Krito. p. 49 C; Apolog. p.
        28 D, 29 C). All these points enhance the interest of the piece,
        and are suited to a destined bride in the flower of her age. But
        an old philosopher of seventy years of age has no such
        attachment to life remaining. He contemplates death with the eye
        of calm reason: he has not only silenced &#8220;the child within us
        who fears death&#8221; (to use the remarkable phrase of Plato,
        Ph&aelig;don, p. 77 E), but he knows well that what remains to
        him of life must be short; that it will probably be of little
        value, with diminished powers, mental as well as bodily; and
        that if passed in exile, it will be of no value at all. To close
        his life with dignity is the best thing which can happen to him.
        While by escape from the prison he would have gained little or
        nothing; he is enabled, by refusing the means of escape, to
        manifest an ostentatious deference to the law, and to make peace
        with the Athenian authorities after the opposition which had
        been declared in his Apology. Both in the Kriton and in the
        Ph&aelig;don, Sokrates exhibits the specimen of a man adhering
        to previous conviction, unaffected by impending death, and by
        the apprehensions which that season brings upon ordinary minds;
        estimating all things then as before, with the same tranquil and
        independent reason.</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_10_9"
          id="Sidenotev1_10_9"></a>Harangue of Sokrates delivered in the
        name of the Laws, would have been applauded by all the
        democratical patriots of Athens.</span></p>
    <p>This dialogue puts into the mouth of Sokrates a rhetorical
      harangue forcible and impressive, which he supposes himself to
      hear from personified Nomos or Athens, claiming for herself and
      her laws plenary and unmeasured obedience from all her citizens,
      as a covenant due to her from each. He declares his own heartfelt
      adhesion to the claim. Sokrates is thus made to express the
      feelings and repeat the language of a devoted democratical
      patriot. His doctrine is one which every Athenian audience would
      warmly applaud &#8212; whether heard from speakers in the assembly, from
      litigants in the Dikastery, or from dramatists in the theatre. It
      is a doctrine which orators of all varieties (Perikles, Nikias,
      Kleon, Lysis, Isokrates, Demosthenes, &AElig;schines, Lykurgus)
      would be alike emphatic in upholding: upon which probably Sophists
      habitually displayed their own eloquence, and tested the talents
      of their pupils. It may be considered as almost an Athenian
      common-place. Hence it is all the better fitted for Plato&#8217;s
      purpose of restoring Sokrates to harmony with his fellow-citizens.
      It serves as his protestation of allegiance to Athens, in reply to
      the adverse impressions prevalent against him. The only
      singularity which bestows special pertinence on that which is in
      substance a discourse of venerated common-place, is &#8212; that
      Sokrates proclaims and applies his doctrine of absolute
      submission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page431"
          id="v1page431"></a>431</span> under the precise circumstances
      in which many others, generally patriotic, might be disposed to
      recede from it &#8212; where he is condemned (unjustly, in his own
      persuasion) to suffer death &#8212; yet has the opportunity to escape.
      He is thus presented as a citizen not merely of ordinary loyalty
      but of extraordinary patriotism. Moreover his remarkable constancy
      of residence at Athens is produced as evidence, showing that the
      city was eminently acceptable to him, and that he had no cause of
      complaint against it.<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_13"

          id="Sidenotev1_10_10"></a>The harangue insists upon topics
        common to Sokrates with other citizens, overlooking the
        specialties of his character.</span></p>
    <p>Throughout all this eloquent appeal addressed by Athens to her
      citizen Sokrates, the points insisted on are those common to him
      with other citizens: the marked specialties of his character being
      left unnoticed. Such are the points suitable to the purpose
      (rather Xenophontic than Platonic, herein) of the Kriton; when
      Sokrates is to be brought back within the pale of democratical
      citizenship, and exculpated from the charge of incivism. But when
      we read the language of Sokrates both in the Apology and in the
      Gorgias, we find a very different picture given of the relations
      between him and Athens. We find him there presented as an isolated
      and eccentric individual, a dissenter, not only departing
      altogether from the character and purposes general among his
      fellow-citizens, but also certain to incur dangerous antipathy, in
      so far as he publicly proclaimed what he was. The Kriton takes him
      up as having become a victim to such antipathy: yet as reconciling
      himself with the laws by voluntarily accepting the sentence; and
      as persuaded to do so, moreover, by a piece of rhetoric imbued
      with the most genuine spirit of constitutional democracy. It is
      the compromise of his long-standing dissent with the reigning
      orthodoxy, just before his death. &#7960;&#957; &#949;&#8016;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#943;&#8115; &#967;&#961;&#8052; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#8119;&#957;.<a

        adopting the resolution to obey, from his own conviction; by a
        reason which weighs with him, but which would not weigh with
        others.</span></p>
    <p>Still, however, though adopting the democratical vein of
      sentiment for this purpose, Sokrates is made to adopt it on a
      ground peculiar to himself. His individuality is thus upheld. He
      holds the sentence pronounced <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page432" id="v1page432"></a>432</span>against him to
      have been unjust, but he renounces all use of that plea, because
      the sentence has been legally pronounced by the judicial authority
      of the city, and because he has entered into a covenant with the
      city. He entertains the firm conviction that no one ought to act
      unjustly, or to do evil to others, in any case; not even in the
      case in which they have done injustice or evil to him. &#8220;This (says
      Sokrates) is my conviction, and the principle of my reasoning. Few
      persons do accept it, or ever will: yet between those who do
      accept it, and those who do not &#8212; there can be no common counsel:
      by necessity of the case, each looks upon the other, and upon the
      reasonings of the other, with contempt.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_15"

        this Sokratic reason, but represents feelings common among
        Athenian citizens.</span></p>
    <p>This general doctrine, peculiar to Sokrates, is decisive <i>per
        se</i>, in its application to the actual case, and might have
      been made to conclude the dialogue. But Sokrates introduces it as
      a foundation to the arguments urged by the personified Athenian
      Nomos:&#8212;which, however, are not corollaries from it, nor at all
      peculiar to Sokrates, but represent sentiments held by the
      Athenian democrats more cordially than they were by Sokrates. It
      is thus that the dialogue Kriton embodies, and tries to reconcile,
      both the two distinct elements &#8212; constitutional allegiance, and
      Sokratic individuality. </p>

        individual himself.</span></p>
    <p>Apart from the express purpose of this dialogue, however, the
      general doctrine here proclaimed by Sokrates deserves attention,
      in regard to the other Platonic dialogues which we shall soon
      review. The doctrine involves an emphatic declaration of the
      paramount authority of individual reason and conscience; for the
      individual himself &#8212; but for him alone. &#8220;This (says Sokrates) is,
      and has long been <i>my</i> conviction. It is the basis of the
      whole reasoning. Look well whether you agree to it: for few
      persons do agree to it, or ever will: and between those who do and
      those who do not, there can be no common deliberation: they must
      of necessity despise each other.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_16"

    </div>
    <p>I shall revert to this doctrine in handling other Platonic
      dialogues, particularly the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_10_14"
          id="Sidenotev1_10_14"></a>The Kriton is rhetorical, not
        dialectical. Difference between Rhetoric and Dialectic.</span></p>
    <p>I have already observed that the tone of the Kriton is
      rhetorical, not dialectical &#8212; especially the harangue ascribed to
      Athens. The business of the rhetorician is to plant and establish
      some given point of persuasion, whether as to a general resolution
      or a particular fact, in the bosoms of certain auditors before
      him: hence he gives prominence and emphasis to some views of the
      question, suppressing or discrediting others, and especially
      keeping out of sight all the difficulties surrounding the
      conclusion at which he is aiming. On the other hand, the business
      of the dialectician is, not to establish any foreknown conclusion,
      but to find out which among all supposable conclusions are
      untenable, and which is the most tenable or best. Hence all the
      difficulties attending every one of them must be brought fully
      into view and discussed: until this has been done, the process is
      not terminated, nor can we tell whether any assured conclusion is
      attainable or not. </p>
    <p>Now Plato, in some of his dialogues, especially the Gorgias,
      greatly depreciates rhetoric and its purpose of persuasion:
      elsewhere he employs it himself with ability and effect. The
      discourse which we read in the Kriton is one of his best
      specimens: appealing to pre-established and widespread emotions,
      veneration for parents, love of country, respect for covenants &#8212;
      to justify the resolution of Sokrates in the actual case: working
      up these sentiments into fervour, but neglecting all difficulties,
      limits, and counter-considerations: assuming that the familiar
      phrases of ethics and politics are perfectly understood and
      indisputable. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_10_15"
          id="Sidenotev1_10_15"></a>The Kriton makes powerful appeal to
        the emotions, but overlooks the ratiocinative difficulties, or
        supposes them to be solved.</span></p>
    <p>But these last-mentioned elements &#8212; difficulties, qualifications,
      necessity for definitions even of the most hackneyed words &#8212; would
      have been brought into the foreground had Sokrates pursued the
      dialectical path, which (as we know both from Xenophon and Plato)
      was his real habit and genius. He was perpetually engaged (says <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page434" id="v1page434"></a>434</span>Xenophon<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_10_17" href="#Footnotev1_10_17"><span
          class="sp">17</span></a>) in dialectic enquiry. &#8220;What is the
      Holy, what is the Unholy? What is the Honourable and the Base?
      What is the Just and the Unjust? &amp;c.&#8221; Now in the rhetorical
      appeal embodied in the Kriton, the important question, What is the
      Just and the Unjust (<i>i.e.</i> Justice and Injustice in
      general), is assumed to be already determined and out of the reach
      of dispute. We are called upon to determine what is just and
      unjust in a particular case, as if we already knew what justice
      and injustice meant generally: to inquire about modifications of
      justice, before we have ascertained its essence. This is the
      fundamental assumption involved in the rhetorical process; which
      assumption we shall find Plato often deprecating as
      unphilosophical and preposterous. </p>

      <p>We see in Xenoph. Memor. i. 2, 40-46, iv. 2, 37, in the
        Platonic dialogue Minos and elsewhere, the number of dialectic
        questions which Sokrates might have brought to bear upon the
        harangue in the Kriton, had it been delivered by any opponent
        whom he sought to perplex or confute. What is a law? what are
        the limits of obedience to the laws? Are there no limits (as
        Hobbes is so much denounced for maintaining)? While the
        oligarchy of Thirty were the constituted authority at Athens,
        they ordered Sokrates himself, together with four other
        citizens, to go and arrest a citizen whom they considered
        dangerous to the state, the Salaminian Leon. The other four
        obeyed the order; Sokrates alone disobeyed, and takes credit for
        having done so, considering Leon to be innocent. Which was in
        the right here? the four obedient citizens, or the one
        disobedient? Might not the four have used substantially the same
        arguments to justify their obedience, as those which Sokrates
        hears from personified Athens in the Kriton? We must remember
        that the Thirty had come into authority by resolutions passed
        under constitutional forms, when fear of foreign enemies induced
        the people to sanction the resolutions proposed by a party among
        themselves. The Thirty also ordered Sokrates to abstain from
        discourse with young men; he disobeyed (Xenoph. Memor. iv. 4,
        3). Was he right in disobeying? </p>
      <p>I have indicated briefly these questions, to show how
        completely the rhetorical manner of the Kriton submerges all
        those difficulties, which would form the special matter of
        genuine Sokratic dialectics. </p>
      <p>Schleiermacher (Einleit. zum Kriton, pp. 233, 234) considers
        the Kriton as a composition of special occasion &#8212;
        Gelegenheitsschrift &#8212; which I think is true; but which may be
        said also, in my judgment, of every Platonic dialogue. The term,
        however, in Schleiermacher&#8217;s writing, has a peculiar meaning,
        viz. a composition for which there is no place in the regular
        rank and file of the Platonic dialogues, as he marshals them. He
        remarks the absence of dialectic in the Kriton, and he adduces
        this as one reason for supposing it not to be genuine. </p>
      <p>But it is no surprise to me to find Plato rhetorical in one
        dialogue, dialectical in others. Variety, and want of system,
        seem to me among his most manifest attributes. </p>
      <p>The view taken of the Kriton by Steinhart (Einleit. pp.
        291-302), in the first page of his very rhetorical Introduction,
        coincides pretty much with mine.</p>
    </div>
    <p>So far indeed Sokrates goes in this dialogue, to affirm a <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page435" id="v1page435"></a>435</span>positive



      analogy. That Just and Honourable are, to the mind, what health
      and strength are to the body:&#8212;Unjust and Base, what distemper and
      weakness are to the body. And he follows this up by saying, that
      the general public are incompetent to determine what is just or
      honourable &#8212; as they are incompetent to decide what is wholesome
      or unwholesome. Respecting both one and the other, you must
      consult some one among the professional Experts, who alone are
      competent to advise.<a name="FnAnchorv1_10_18"

    <p>Both these two doctrines will be found recurring often, in our
      survey of the dialogues. The first of the two is an obscure and
      imperfect reply to the great Sokratic problem &#8212; What is Justice?
      What is Injustice? but it is an analogy useful to keep in mind, as
      a help to the exposition of many passages in which Plato is yet
      more obscure. The second of the two will also recur frequently. It
      sets out an antithesis of great moment in the Platonic dialogues &#8212;
      &#8220;The one specially instructed, professional, theorizing, Expert &#8212;
      <i>versus</i> (the &#7984;&#948;&#953;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953; of the time and place, or) common
      sense, common sentiment, intuition, instinct, prejudice,&#8221; &amp;c.
      (all these names meaning the same objective reality, but
      diversified according as the speaker may happen to regard the
      particular case to which he is alluding). This antithesis appears
      as an answer when we put the question &#8212; What is the ultimate
      authority? where does the right of final decision reside, on
      problems and disputes ethical, political, &aelig;sthetical? It
      resides (Sokrates here answers) with some one among a few
      professional Experts. They are the only persons competent. </p>

          id="Sidenotev1_10_17"></a>Procedure of Sokrates after this
        comparison has been declared &#8212; he does not name who the
        trustworthy Expert is.</span></p>
    <p>I shall go more fully into this question elsewhere. Here I shall
      merely notice the application which Sokrates makes (in the Kriton)
      of the general doctrine. We might anticipate that after having
      declared that none was fit to pronounce upon the Just and the
      Unjust, except a professional Expert, &#8212; he would have proceeded to
      name some person corresponding to that designation &#8212; to justify
      the title of that person to confidence by such evidences as Plato
      requires in other dialogues &#8212; and then to cite the decision of the
      judge named, on the case in hand. This is what Sokrates would have
      done, if the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page436"
          id="v1page436"></a>436</span>case had been one of health or
      sickness. He would have said &#8220;I appeal to Hippokrates, Akumenus,
      &amp;c., as professional Experts on medicine: they have given
      proof of competence by special study, successful practice,
      writing, teaching, &amp;c.: they pronounce so and so&#8221;. He would
      not have considered himself competent to form a judgment or

        he finds authority in his own reason and conscience.</span></p>
    <p>But here, when the case in hand is that of Just and Unjust, the
      conduct of Sokrates is altogether different. He specifies no
      professional Expert, and he proceeds to lay down a dogma of his
      own; in which he tells us that few or none will agree, though it
      is fundamental, so that dissenters on the point must despise each
      other as heretics. We thus see that it is he alone who steps in to
      act himself the part of professional Expert, though he does not
      openly assume the title. The ultimate authority is proclaimed in
      words to reside with some unnamed Expert: in fact and reality, he
      finds it in his own reason and conscience. You are not competent
      to judge for yourself: you must consult the professional Expert:
      but your own reason and conscience must signify to you who the
      Expert is. </p>
    <p>The analogy here produced by Plato of questions about health and
      sickness &#8212; is followed out only in its negative operation; as it
      serves to scare away the multitude, and discredit the Vox Populi.
      But when this has been done, no oracular man can be produced or
      authenticated. In other dialogues, we shall find Sokrates
      regretting the absence of such an oracular man, but professing
      inability to proceed without him. In the Kriton, he undertakes the
      duty himself; unmindful of the many emphatic speeches in which he
      had proclaimed his own ignorance, and taken credit for confessing
      it without reserve.</p>

    <p>The dialogue called Euthyphron, over and above its contribution
      to the ethical enquiries of Plato, has a certain bearing on the

    <p>The indictment by Mel&ecirc;tus against Sokrates is assumed to
      have been formally entered in the office of the King Archon.
      Sokrates has come to plead to it. In the portico before that
      office, he meets Euthyphron: a man of ultra-pious pretensions,
      possessing special religious knowledge (either from revelation
      directly to himself, or from having been initiated in the various
      mysteries consecrated throughout Greece), delivering authoritative
      opinions on doubtful theological points, and prophesying future

      commendable interest in the training of youth, and has indicted me
      as a corruptor of youth. He says that I corrupt them by teaching

    <p><i>Euthyph.</i> &#8212; I understand: it is because you talk about the

    <p><i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; To be laughed at is no great matter. The Athenians
      do not care much when they regard a man as overwise, but as not

      besides, as likely to make others such as he is himself, they

        prosecuting an indictment for murder against his own father &#8212;
        Displeasure of his friends at the proceeding.</span></p>
    <p>Sokrates now learns what is Euthyphron&#8217;s business at the
      archontic office. Euthyphron is prosecuting an indictment before
      the King Archon, against his own father; as having caused the
      death of a dependent workman, who in a fit of intoxication had
      quarrelled with and killed a fellow-servant. The father of
      Euthyphron, upon this occurrence, bound the homicide hand and
      foot, and threw him into a ditch: at the same time sending to the
      Ex&ecirc;g&ecirc;t&ecirc;s (the canonical adviser, supposed to be
      conversant with the divine sanctions, whom it was customary to
      consult when doubts arose about sacred things) to ask what was to
      be done with him. The incident occurred at Naxos, and the
      messenger was sent to the Ex&ecirc;g&ecirc;t&ecirc;s at Athens:
      before he could return, the prisoner had perished, from hunger,
      cold, and bonds. Euthyphron has indicted his father for homicide,
      as having caused the death of the prisoner: who (it would appear)
      had remained in the ditch, tied hand and foot, without food, and
      with no more than his ordinary clothing, during the time occupied
      in the voyage from Naxos to Athens, in obtaining the answer of the
      Ex&ecirc;g&ecirc;t&ecirc;s, and in returning to Naxos. </p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page439" id="v1page439"></a>439</span></p>
    <p>My friends and relatives (says Euthyphron) cry out against me for
      this proceeding, as if I were mad. They say that my father did not
      kill the man:<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_4" href="#Footnotev1_11_4"><span
          class="sp">4</span></a> that even if he had, the man had
      committed murder: lastly, that however the case may have been, to
      indict my own father is monstrous and inexcusable. Such reasoning
      is silly. The only point to be considered is, whether my father
      killed the deceased justly or unjustly. If justly there is nothing
      to be said; if unjustly, then my father becomes a man tainted with
      impiety and accursed. I and every one else, who, knowing the
      facts, live under the same roof and at the same table with him,
      come under the like curse; unless I purify myself by bringing him
      to justice. The course which I am now taking is prescribed by
      piety or holiness. My friends indeed tell me that it is unholy for
      a son to indict his father. But I know better than they, what
      holiness is and I should be ashamed of myself if I did not.<a

        Plato, Euthyphron, c. 4, p. 4. Respecting the &#956;&#943;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945;, which a
        person who had committed criminal homicide was supposed to carry
        about with him wherever he went, communicating it both to places
        and to companions, see Antiphon. Tetralog. i. 2, 5, 10; iii. s.
        7, p. 116; and De Herodis C&aelig;de s. 81, p. 139. The argument
        here employed by Euthyphron is used also by the Platonic
        Sokrates in the Gorgias, 480 C-D. If a man has committed
        injustice, punishment is the only way of curing him. That he
        should escape unpunished is the worst thing that can happen to
        him. If you yourself, or your father, or your friend, have
        committed injustice, do not seek to avert the punishment either
        from yourself or them, but rather invoke it. This is exactly
        what Euthyphron is doing, and what the Platonic Sokrates (in
        dialogue Euthyphron) calls in question.</p>

        Plato, Euthyphron, c. 6, p. 5 D. Among the various reasons (none
        of them valid in my judgment) given by Ueberweg (Untersuch. p.
        251) for suspecting the authenticity of the Euthyphron, one is
        that &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#957;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; is reckoned as an &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; as well as &#964;&#8056; &#8005;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;.
        Ueberweg seems to think this absurd, since he annexes to the
        word a note of admiration. But Plato expressly gives &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957;
        as an &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;, along with &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; (Repub. v. 476 A); and one of
        the objections taken against his theory by Aristotle was, that
        it would assume substantive Ideas corresponding to negative
        terms &#8212; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#957; &#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945;&#962;. See Aristot. Metaphys. A. 990, b.

      truth, I must bow to your superior knowledge. I cannot help doing
      so, since for my part I pretend to no knowledge whatever about

    <p>I am persuaded that these narratives are true (says Euthyphron):
      and not only they, but many other narratives yet more surprising,
      of which most persons are ignorant. I can tell you some of them,
      if you like to hear. You shall tell me another time (replies

        relative position of Sokrates and the Athenian public.</span></p>
    <p>Before we pursue this enquiry respecting holiness, which is the
      portion of the dialogue bearing on the Platonic ethics, I will say
      one word on the portion which has preceded, and which appears to
      bear on the position and character of Sokrates. He (Sokrates) has
      incurred odium from the Dikastery and the public, because he is
      heretical and incredulous. &#8220;He does not believe in those Gods in
      whom the city believes, but introduces religious novelties&#8221; &#8212; to
      use the words of the indictment preferred against him by
      Mel&ecirc;tus. The Athenian public felt the same displeasure and
      offence in hearing their divine legends, such as those of Zeus and
      Kronus,<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_11" href="#Footnotev1_11_11"><span
          class="sp">11</span></a> called in question or criticised in
      an ethical spirit different from their own &#8212; as is felt by Jews or
      Christians when various narratives of the Old Testament are
      criticised in an adverse spirit, and when the proceedings ascribed
      to Jehovah are represented as unworthy of a just and beneficent
      god. We read in Herodotus what was the sentiment of pious
      contemporaries respecting narratives of divine matters. Herodotus
      keeps back many of them by design, and announces that he will
      never recite them except in case of necessity: while in one
      instance, where he has been betrayed into criticism upon a few of
      them, as inconsiderate and incredible, he is seized with
      misgivings, and prays that Gods and heroes will not be offended
      with him.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_12" href="#Footnotev1_11_12"><span
          class="sp">12</span></a> The freethinkers, among whom Sokrates
      was numbered, were the persons from whom adverse criticism came.
      It is these men who are depicted by orthodox opponents as
      committing lawless acts, and justifying themselves by precedents <span

          views</a> on the theological legends generally believed by his
        countrymen, when I come to the language which he puts into the
        mouth of Sokrates in the second and third books of the Republic.
        Eusebius considers it matter of praise when he says &#8220;that Plato

        retorted by Plato against the orthodox champion.</span></p>
    <p>Now in the dialogue here before us, Plato retorts this attack.
      Euthyphron possesses in the fullest measure the virtues of a
      believer. He believes not only all that orthodox Athenians usually
      believed respecting the Gods, but more besides.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_11_15" href="#Footnotev1_11_15"><span
          class="sp">15</span></a> His faith is so implicit, that he
      proclaims it as accurate knowledge, and carries it into practice
      with full confidence; reproaching other orthodox persons with
      inconsistency and short-coming, and disregarding the judgment of
      the multitude, as Sokrates does in the Kriton.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_11_16" href="#Footnotev1_11_16"><span
          class="sp">16</span></a> Euthyphron stands forward as the
      champion of the Gods, determined not to leave unpunished the man
      who has committed impiety, let him be who he may.<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_11_17" href="#Footnotev1_11_17"><span
          class="sp">17</span></a> These lofty religious pretensions
      impel him, with full persuasion of right, to indict his own father
      for homicide, under the circumstances above described. Now in the
      eyes of the Athenian public, there could hardly be any act more
      abhorrent, than that of a man thus invoking upon his father the
      severest penalties of law. It would probably be not less abhorrent
      than that of a son beating his own father. When therefore we read,
      in the Nubes of Aristophanes, the dramatic moral set forth against
      Sokrates, &#8220;See the consequences to which free-thinking and the new
      system of education lead<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_18"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> &#8212; the
      son Pheidippides beating his own father, and justifying the action
      as right, by citing the violence of Zeus towards his father
      Kronus&#8221; &#8212; we may take the Platonic Euthyphron as an antithesis to
      this moral, propounded by a defender of Sokrates, &#8220;See the
      consequences to which consistent orthodoxy and implicit faith
      conduct. The son Euthyphron indicts his own <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v1page443" id="v1page443"></a>443</span>father for
      homicide; he vindicates the step as conformable to the proceedings
      of the gods; he even prides himself on it as championship on their
      behalf, such as all religious men ought to approve.&#8221;<a

        his conception of its &#8220;unverkennbare apologetische Absicht&#8221; is
        very much the same as mine. He describes Euthyphron as a man
        &#8220;der sich besonders auf das G&ouml;ttliche zu verstehen vorgab,
        und die rechtglaubigen aus den alten theologischen Dichtern
        gezogenen Begriffe tapfer vertheidigte. Diesen nun gerade bei
        der Anklage des Sokrates mit ihm in Ber&uuml;hrung, und durch
        den unsittlichen Streich, den sein Eifer f&uuml;r die
        Fr&ouml;mmigkeit veranlasste, in Gegensatz zu bringen &#8212; war ein
        des Platon nicht unw&uuml;rdiger Gedanke&#8221; (p. 54). But when
        Schleiermacher affirms that the dialogue was indisputably
        composed (unstreitig) between the indictment and the trial of
        Sokrates, &#8212; and when he explains what he considers the defects
        of the dialogue, by the necessity of finishing it in a hurry (p.
        53), I dissent from him altogether, though Steinhart adopts the
        same opinion. Nor can I perceive in what way the Euthyphron is
        (as he affirms) either &#8220;a natural out-growth of the Protagoras,&#8221;
        or &#8220;an approximation and preparation for the Parmenid&ecirc;s&#8221;
        (p. 52). Still less do I feel the force of his reasons for
        hesitating in admitting it to be a genuine work of Plato. </p>
      <p>I have given my reasons, in a preceding <a
          href="#Sidenotev1_7_29">chapter</a>, for believing that Plato
        composed no dialogues at all during the lifetime of Sokrates.
        But that he should publish such a dialogue while the trial of
        Sokrates was impending, is a supposition altogether
        inadmissible, in my judgment. The effect of it would be to make
        the position of Sokrates much worse on his trial. Herein I agree
        with Ueberweg (Untersuch. p. 250), though I do not share his
        doubts of the authenticity of the dialogue. </p>
      <p>The confident assertion of Stallbaum surprises me. &#8220;Constat
        enim Platonem eo tempore, quo Socrati tantum erat odium
        conflatum, ut ei judicii immineret periculum, complures dialogos
        composuisse; in quibus id egit, ut viri sanctissimi adversarios
        in eo ipso genere, in quo sibi plurimum sapere videbantur,
        insciti&aelig; et ignoranti&aelig; coargueret. Nam Euthyphronem
        novimus, ad vates ignoranti&aelig; rerum gravissimarum
        convincendos, esse compositum; ut in quo eos ne pietatis quidem
        notionem tenere ostenditur. In Menone autem id agitur, ut
        sophistas et viros civiles non scienti&acirc; atque arte, sed
        c&#339;co quodam impetu mentis et sorte divin&acirc; duci
        demonstretur: quod quidem ita fit, ut colloquium ex parte cum
        Anyto, Socratis accusatore, habeatur.&#8230; Nam Menonem quidem et
        Euthyphronem Plato eo confecit tempore, quo Socratis causa haud
        ita pridem in judicio versabatur, nec tamen jam tanta ei
        videbatur imminere calamitas, quanta postea consecuta est. Ex
        quo san&eacute; verisimiliter colligere licet Ionem, cujus
        simile argumentum et consilium est, circa idem tempus literis
        consignatum esse.&#8221; Stallbaum, Prolegom. ad Platonis Ionem, pp.
        288-289, vol. iv. [Comp. Stallb. ibid., 2nd ed. pp. 339-341]. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Imo uno exemplo Euthyphronis, boni quidem hominis ideoque ne
        Socrati quidem inimici, sed ejusdem <i>superstitiosi, vel ut
          hodie loquuntur, orthodoxi</i>, qualis Athenis vulg&ograve;
        esset religionis conditio, declarare instituit. Ex quo nobis
        quidem clarissim&eacute; videtur apparere Platonem hoc unum
        spectavisse, ut judices admonerentur, ne populari superstitioni
        in sententiis ferendis plus justo tribuerent.&#8221; Stallbaum,
        Proleg. ad Euthyphron. T. vi. p. 146. </p>
      <p>Steinhart also (in his Einleitung, p. 190) calls Euthyphron
        &#8220;ein rechtgl&auml;ubiger von reinsten Wasser &#8212; ein ueberfrommer,
        fanatischer, Mann,&#8221; &amp;c. </p>
      <p>In the two preceding pages Stallbaum defends himself against
        objections made to his view, on the ground that Plato, by
        composing such dialogues at this critical moment, would increase
        the unpopularity and danger of Sokrates, instead of diminishing
        it. Stallbaum contends (p. 145) that neither Sokrates nor Plato
        nor any of the other Sokratic men, believed that the trial would
        end in a verdict of guilty: which is probably true about Plato,
        and would have been borne out by the event if Sokrates had made
        a different defence. But this does not assist the conclusion
        which Stallbaum wishes to bring out; for it is not the less true
        that the dialogues of Plato, if published at that moment, would
        increase the exasperation against Sokrates, and the chance,
        whatever it was, that he would be found guilty. Stallbaum refers
        by mistake to a passage in the Platonic Apology (p. 36 A), as if
        Sokrates there expressed his surprise at the verdict of guilty,
        anticipating a verdict of acquittal. The passage declares the
        contrary: Sokrates expresses his surprise that the verdict of
        guilty had passed by so small a majority as five; he had
        expected that it would pass by a larger majority.</p>

    <p>I proceed now with that which may be called the Platonic purpose
      in the dialogue &#8212; the enquiry into the general idea of Holiness.
      When the question was first put to Euthyphron, What is the Holy? &#8212;
      he replied, &#8220;That which I am now doing.&#8221; <i>Sokr.</i> That may
      be: but many other things besides are also holy. &#8212; <i>Euthyph.</i>
      Certainly. &#8212; <i>Sokr.</i> Then your answer does not meet the
      question. You have indicated one particular holy act, among many.
      But the question asked was &#8212; What is Holiness generally? What is
      that specific property, by the common possession of which all holy
      things are entitled to be called holy? I want to know this general
      Idea, in order that I may keep it in view as a type wherewith to
      compare each particular case, thus determining whether the case
      deserves to be called holy or not.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_20"

    <p>Here we have a genuine specimen of the dialectic interrogatory in

        href="#Footnotev1_11_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Sokrates
      to have passed his life, and which Plato prosecutes under his

        discussion.</span></p>
    <p>It is assumed that there is one specific Idea or essence &#8212; one
      objective characteristic or fact &#8212; common to all things called
      Holy. The purpose of the questioner is: to determine what this
      Idea is: to provide a good definition of the word. The first
      mistake made by the respondent is, that he names simply one
      particular case, coming under the general Idea. This is a mistake
      often recurring, and often corrected in the Platonic dialogues.
      Even now, such a mistake is not unfrequent: and in the time of
      Plato, when general ideas, and the definition of general terms,
      had been made so little the subject of direct attention, it was
      doubtless perpetually made. When the question was first put, its
      bearing <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page445" id="v1page445"></a>445</span>would



      not be properly conceived. And even if the bearing were properly
      conceived, men would find it easier then, and do find it easier
      now, to make answer by giving one particular example than to go
      over many examples, and elicit what is common to all. </p>

        Euthyphron &#8212; that which is pleasing to the Gods is holy.
        Comments of Sokrates thereon.</span></p>
    <p>Euthyphron next replies &#8212; That which is pleasing to the Gods is
      holy: that which is not pleasing, or which is displeasing to the
      Gods, is unholy. &#8212; <i>Sokr.</i> That is the sort of answer which
      I desired to have: now let us examine it. We learn from the
      received theology, which you implicitly believe, that there has
      been much discord and quarrel among the Gods. If the Gods quarrel,
      they quarrel about the same matters as men. Now men do not quarrel
      about questions of quantity &#8212; for such questions can be determined
      by calculation and measurement: nor about questions of weight &#8212;
      for there the balance may be appealed to. The questions about
      which you and I and other men quarrel are, What is just or unjust,
      honourable or base, good or evil? Upon these there is no
      accessible standard. Some men feel in one way, some in another;
      and each of us fights for his own opinions.<a

        In regard to Plato&#8217;s ethical enquiries generally, and to what we
        shall find in future dialogues, we must take note of what is
        here laid down, that mankind are in perpetual dispute, and have
        not yet any determinate standard for just and unjust, right and
        wrong, honourable and base, good and evil. Plato had told us,
        somewhat differently, in the Kriton, that on these matters,
        though the judgment of the many was not to be trusted, yet there
        was another trustworthy judgment, that of the one wise man. This
        point will recur for future comment.</p>
    </div>
    <p><i>Euthyph.</i> &#8212; I am convinced that there are some things which
      <i>all</i> the Gods love, and some things which <i>all</i> the
      Gods hate. That which I am doing, for example &#8212; indicting my
      father for homicide &#8212; belongs to the former category. Now that
      which all the Gods love is the holy: that which they all hate, is
      the unholy.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_25" href="#Footnotev1_11_25"><span

    <p><i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; Do the Gods love the holy, because it <i>is</i>

      You have yet to tell me what that essential character is, by
      virtue of which the holy comes to be loved by all the Gods, or to
      be the subject of various other attributes.<a

    <p>Euthyphron does not at first understand the question. He does not
      comprehend the relation between two words, generic and specific
      with reference to each other: the former embracing all that the
      latter embraces, and more besides (denoting more objects,
      connoting fewer attributes). This is explained by analogies and
      particular examples, illustrating a logical distinction highly

      treatises on Logic.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_29"

      Just. But what part? or how is it to be distinguished from other
      parts or branches of the just? Euthyphron answers. The holy is
      that portion or branch of the Just which concerns ministration to
      the Gods: the remaining branch of the Just is, what concerns
      ministration to men.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_30"

    <p><i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; What sort of ministration? Other ministrations, to
      horses, dogs, working cattle, &amp;c., are intended for the
      improvement or benefit of those to whom they are
      rendered:&#8212;besides, they can only be rendered by a few trained
      persons. In what manner does ministration, called <i>holiness</i>,
      benefit or improve the Gods? <i>Euthyph.</i> &#8212; In no way: it is
      of the same nature as that which slaves render to their masters. <i>Sokr.</i>
      &#8212; You mean, that it is work done by us for the Gods. Tell me &#8212; to
      what end does the work conduce? What is that end which the Gods
      accomplish, through our agency as workmen? Physicians employ their
      slaves for the purpose of restoring the sick to health:
      shipbuilders put their slaves to the completion of ships. But what
      are those great works which the Gods bring about by our agency? <i>Euthyph.</i>
      &#8212; Their works are numerous and great. <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; The like may
      be <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page448" id="v1page448"></a>448</span>said



      of generals: but the summary and main purpose of all that generals
      do is &#8212; to assure victory in war. So too we may say about the
      husbandman: but the summary of his many proceedings is, to raise
      corn from the earth. State to me, in like manner, the summary of

    <p><i>Euthyph.</i> &#8212; It would cost me some labour to go through the
      case fully. But so much I tell you in plain terms. If a man, when
      sacrificing and praying, knows what deeds and what words will be
      agreeable to the Gods, that is holiness: this it is which upholds
      the security both of private houses and public communities. The

      the knowledge of rightly sacrificing and praying to the Gods; that
      is, of giving to them, and asking from them. To ask rightly, is to
      ask what we want from them: to give rightly, is to give to them
      what they want from us. Holiness will thus be an art of right
      traffic between Gods and men. Still, you must tell me how the Gods

        confessed ignorance applying the Elenchus to false persuasion of
        knowledge.</span></p>
    <p>So Plato breaks off the dialogue. It is conceived in the truly
      Sokratic spirit:&#8212;an Elenchus applied to implicit and unexamined
      faith, even though that faith be accredited among the public as
      orthodoxy: warfare against the confident persuasion of knowledge,
      upon topics familiar to every one, and on which deep sentiments
      and confused notions have grown up by association in every one&#8217;s
      mind, without deliberate study, systematic teaching, or testing
      cross-examination. Euthyphron is a man who feels unshaken
      confidence in his own knowledge, and still more in his own correct
      religious belief. Sokrates appears in his received character as
      confessing ignorance, soliciting instruction, and exposing
      inconsistencies and contradiction in that which is given to him
      for instruction. </p>
    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev1_11_19"

        often impossible to answer. Sokrates is unable to answer them,
        though he exposes the bad answers of others.</span></p>
    <p>We must (as I have before remarked) take this ignorance on the
      part of the Platonic Sokrates not as assumed, but as very real. In
      no part of the Platonic writings do we find any tenable definition
      of the Holy and the Unholy, such as is here demanded from
      Euthyphron. The talent of Sokrates consists in exposing bad
      definitions, not in providing good ones. This negative function is
      all that he claims for himself &#8212; with deep regret that he can do
      no more. &#8220;Sokrates&#8221; (says Aristotle<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_34"

      questions, but gave no answers: for he professed not to know.&#8221; In
      those dialogues where Plato makes him attempt more (there also,
      against his own will <span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page450"
          id="v1page450"></a>450</span>and protest, as in the
      Phil&ecirc;bus and Republic), the affirmative Sokrates will be
      found only to stand his ground because no negative Sokrates is
      allowed to attack him. I insist upon this the rather, because the
      Platonic commentators usually present the dialogues in a different
      light, as if such modesty on the part of Sokrates was altogether
      simulated: as if he was himself,<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_35"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> from the
      beginning, aware of the proper answer to his own questions, but
      refrained designedly from announcing it: nay, sometimes, as if the
      answers were in themselves easy, and as if the respondents who
      failed must be below par in respect of intelligence. This is an
      erroneous conception. The questions put by Sokrates, though
      relating to familiar topics, are always difficult: they are often
      even impossible to answer, because they postulate and require to
      be assigned a common objective concept which is not to be found.
      They only appear easy to one who has never attempted the task of
      answering under the pressure of cross-examination. Most persons
      indeed never make any such trial, but go on affirming confidently
      as if they knew, without trial. It is exactly against such
      illusory confidence of knowledge that Sokrates directs his
      questions: the fact belongs to our days no less than to his.<a

        Adam Smith observes, in his Essay on the Formation of Languages
        (p. 20 of the fifth volume of his collected Works), &#8220;Ask a man
        what relation is expressed by the preposition <i>of</i>: and if
        he has not beforehand employed his thoughts a good deal upon
        these subjects, you may safely allow him a week to consider of
        his answer.&#8221; </p>
      <p>The Platonic problem assumes, not only that he shall give an
        answer, but that it shall be an answer which he can maintain
        against the Elenchus of Sokrates.</p>

          id="Sidenotev1_11_20"></a>Objections of Theopompus to the
        Platonic procedure.</span></p>
    <p>The assumptions of some Platonic commentators &#8212; that Sokrates and
      Plato of course knew the answers to their own questions &#8212; that an
      honest and pious man, of ordinary intelligence, has the answer to
      the question in his heart, though he cannot put it in words &#8212;
      these assumptions were also made by many of Plato&#8217;s
      contemporaries, who depreciated his questions as frivolous and
      unprofitable. The rhetor and historian Theopompus (one of the most
      eminent among the numerous pupils of Isokrates, and at the same
      time unfriendly to Plato, though younger in age), thus criticised
      Plato&#8217;s requirement, that these familiar terms should be defined:
      &#8220;What! (said he) have none of us before your time talked about <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page451" id="v1page451"></a>451</span>the



      Good and the Just? Or do you suppose that we cannot follow out
      what each of them is, and that we pronounce the words as empty and
      unmeaning sounds?&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_37"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
      Theopompus was the scholar of Isokrates, and both of them probably
      took the same view, as to the uselessness of that colloquial
      analysis which aims at determining the definition of familiar
      ethical or political words.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_38"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> They
      considered that Plato and Sokrates, instead of clearing up what
      was confused, wasted their ingenuity in perplexing what was
      already clear. They preferred the rhetorical handling (such as we
      noticed in the Kriton) which works upon ready-made pre-established
      sentiments, and impresses a strong emotional conviction, but
      presumes that all the intellectual problems have already been
      solved. </p>

    <p>All this shows the novelty of the Sokratic point of view: the

      accidental accompaniment,<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_39"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> and the
      search for a definition corresponding to the former: which search
      was first prosecuted by Sokrates (as Aristotle<a
        name="FnAnchorv1_11_40" href="#Footnotev1_11_40"><span
          class="sp">40</span></a> points out) and was taken up from him
      by Plato. It was Sokrates who first brought conspicuously into
      notice the objective intellectual, scientific view of ethics &#8212; as
      distinguished from the subjective, emotional, incoherent, and
      uninquiring. I mean that he was the first who proclaimed himself
      as feeling the want of such an objective view, and who worked upon
      other minds so as to create the like want in them: I do not mean
      that he provided satisfaction for this requirement. </p>

    <p>Undoubtedly (as Theopompus remarked) men had used these ethical
      terms long before the time of Sokrates, and had used them, not as
      empty and unmeaning, but with a full body of meaning (<i>i.e.</i>
      emotional meaning). Strong and marked emotion had become
      associated with each term; and the same emotion, similar in <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page452" id="v1page452"></a>452</span>
      character, though not equal in force &#8212; was felt by the greater
      number of different minds. Subjectively and emotionally, there was
      no difference between one man and another, except as to degree.
      But it was Sokrates who first called attention to the fact as a
      matter for philosophical recognition and criticism, &#8212; that such
      subjective and emotional unanimity does not exclude the widest
      objective and intellectual dissension.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_41"

        upon this mental condition by Sokrates &#8212; position of Sokrates
        and Plato in regard to it.</span></p>
    <p>As the Platonic Sokrates here puts it in the Euthyphron &#8212; all men
      agree that the person who acts unjustly must be punished; but they
      dispute very much <i>who it is</i> that acts unjustly &#8212; <i>which</i>
      of his actions are unjust &#8212; or under <i>what</i> circumstances
      they are so. The emotion in each man&#8217;s mind, as well as the word
      by which it is expressed, is the same:<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_42"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> but the
      person, or the acts, to which it is applied by each, although
      partly the same, are often so different, and sometimes so
      opposite, as to occasion violent dispute. There is subjective
      agreement, with objective disagreement. It is upon <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v1page453" id="v1page453"></a>453</span>this



      disconformity that the Sokratic cross-examination is brought to
      bear, making his hearers feel its existence, for the first time,
      and dispelling their fancy of supposed knowledge as well as of
      supposed unanimity. Sokrates required them to define the general
      word &#8212; to assign some common objective characteristic,
      corresponding in all cases to the common subjective feeling
      represented by the word. But no man could comply with his
      requirement, nor could he himself comply with it, any more than
      his respondents. So far Sokrates proceeded, and no farther,
      according to Aristotle. He never altogether lost his hold on
      particulars: he assumed that there must be something common to
      them all, if you could but find out what it was, constituting the
      objective meaning of the general term. Plato made a step beyond
      him, though under the name of Sokrates as spokesman. Not being
      able (any more than Sokrates) to discover or specify any real
      objective characteristic, common to all the particulars &#8212; he
      objectivised<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_43" href="#Footnotev1_11_43"><span
          class="sp">43</span></a> the word itself: that is, he assumed
      or imagined a new objective Ens of his own, the Platonic Idea,
      corresponding to the general word: an idea not common to the
      particulars, but existing apart from them in a sphere of its own &#8212;
      yet nevertheless lending itself in some inexplicable way to be
      participated by all the particulars. It was only in this way that
      Plato could explain to himself how knowledge was possible: this
      universal Ens being the only object of knowledge: particulars
      being an indefinite variety of fleeting appearances, and as such
      in themselves unknowable. The imagination of Plato created a new
      world of Forms, Ideas, Concepts, or objects corresponding to
      general terms: which he represents as the only objects of
      knowledge, and as the only realities. </p>

      <p>Hobbes expresses, in the following terms, this fact of
        subjective similarity co-existent with great objective
        dissimilarity among mankind. </p>
      <p>&#8220;For the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to
        the thoughts and passions of another, whoever looketh into
        himself and considereth what he does when he does <i>think</i>,
        <i>opine</i>, <i>reason</i>, <i>hope</i>, <i>fear</i>,
        &amp;c., and upon what grounds, he shall thereby read and know
        what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the
        like occasions. I say the similitude of <i>passions</i>, which
        are the same in all men, <i>desire</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>hope</i>,
        &amp;c., not the similitude of the <i>objects</i> of the
        passions, which are the things <i>desired</i>, <i>feared</i>,
        <i>hoped</i>, &amp;c., for these the constitution individual,
        and particular education do so vary, and they are so easy to be
        kept from our knowledge, that the characters of man&#8217;s heart,
        blotted and confounded as they are with lying, dissembling,

      Sokrates and with ordinary men among the world of particulars,
      only that Sokrates introduced a new mode of looking at all the
      particulars, and searched among them for some common feature which
      he did not find. The Holy (and the Unholy) is a word freely
      pronounced by every speaker, and familiarly understood by every

    <p>The definition of the Holy &#8212; that it is what the Gods love &#8212; is
      suggested in this dialogue, but rejected. The Holy is not Holy
      because the Gods love it: on the contrary, its holiness is an
      independent fact, and the Gods love it because it is Holy. The
      Holy is thus an essence, <i>per se</i>, common to, or partaken
      by, all holy persons and things. </p>

        respecting the Holy &#8212; different from those of the Platonic
        Sokrates &#8212; he disallows any common absolute general type of the
        Holy &#8212; he recognises an indefinite variety of types, discordant
        and relative.</span></p>
    <p>So at least the Platonic Sokrates here regards it. But the
      Xenophontic Sokrates, if we can trust the Memorabilia, would not
      have concurred in this view: for we read that upon all points
      connected with piety or religious observance, he followed the
      precept which the Pythian priestess delivered as an answer to all
      who consulted the Delphian oracle on similar questions &#8212; You will
      act piously by conforming to the law of the city. Sokrates (we are
      told) not only acted upon this precept himself, but advised his
      friends to do the like, and regarded those who acted otherwise as
      foolish and over-subtle triflers.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_45"
        href="#Footnotev1_11_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> It is
      plain that this doctrine disallows all supposition of any general
      essence, called the Holy, to be discovered and appealed to, as
      type in cases of doubt; and recognises the equal title of many
      separate local, dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="v1page455"
          id="v1page455"></a>455</span>cordant, and variable types, each
      under the sanction of King Nomos. The procedure of Sokrates in the
      Euthyphron would not have been approved by the Xenophontic
      Sokrates. It is in the spirit of Plato, and is an instance of that
      disposition which he manifests yet more strongly in the Republic
      and elsewhere, to look for his supreme authority in philosophical
      theory and not in the constituted societies around him: thus to
      innovate in matters religious as well as political &#8212; a reproach to
      him among his own contemporaries, an honour to him among various
      subsequent Christian writers. Plato, not conforming to any one of
      the modes of religious belief actually prevalent in his
      contemporary world, postulates a canon, suitable to the exigencies
      of his own mind, of that which the Gods ought to love and must
      love. In this respect, as in others, he is in marked contrast with
      Herodotus &#8212; a large observer of mankind, very pious in his own
      way, curious in comparing the actual practices consecrated among
      different nations, but not pretending to supersede them by any
      canon of his own. </p>

        subordination of logical terms.</span></p>
    <p>Though the Holy, and the Unholy, are pronounced to be each an
      essence, partaken of by all the particulars so-called; yet what
      that essence is, the dialogue Euthyphron noway determines. Even
      the suggestion of Sokrates &#8212; that the Holy is a branch of the
      Just, only requiring to be distinguished by some assignable mark
      from the other branches of the Just &#8212; is of no avail, since the
      Just itself had been previously declared to be one of the matters
      in perpetual dispute. It procures for Sokrates however the
      opportunity of illustrating the logical subordination of terms;
      the less general comprehended in the more general, and requiring
      to be parted off by some <i>differentia</i> from the rest of what
      this latter comprehends. Plato illustrates the matter at some
      length;<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_46" href="#Footnotev1_11_46"><span
          class="sp">46</span></a> and apparently with a marked purpose
      of drawing attention to it. We must keep in mind, that logical
      distinctions had at that time received neither special attention

      followed in practice. </p>

      the Euthyphron. It represents Plato&#8217;s manner of replying to the
      charge of impiety advanced by Mel&ecirc;tus and his friends
      against Sokrates, just as the four first chapters of the
      Memorabilia represent Xenophon&#8217;s manner of repelling the same
      charge. Xenophon joins issue with the accusers, &#8212; describes the
      language and proceedings of Sokrates, so as to show that he was
      orthodox and pious, above the measure of ordinary men, in conduct,
      in ritual, and in language; and expresses his surprise that
      against such a man the verdict of guilty could have been returned
      by the Dikasts.<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_47" href="#Footnotev1_11_47"><span
          class="sp">47</span></a> Plato handles the charge in the way
      in which Sokrates himself would have handled it, if he had been
      commenting on the same accusation against another person and as he
      does in fact deal with Mel&ecirc;tus, in the Platonic Apology.
      Plato introduces Euthyphron, a very religious man, who prides
      himself upon being forward to prosecute impiety in whomsoever it
      is found, and who in this case, under the special promptings of
      piety, has entered a capital prosecution against his own father.<a

      the Sokratic interrogatories, applicable to Mel&ecirc;tus no less
      than to Euthyphron. &#8220;Of course, before you took this grave step,
      you have assured yourself that you are right, and that you know
      what piety and impiety are. Pray tell me, for I am ignorant on the
      subject: that I may know better and do better for the future.<a

      accuser can make no satisfactory answer: that he involves himself
      in confusion and contradiction:&#8212;that he has brought capital
      indictments against citizens, without having ever studied or
      appreciated the offence with which he charges them. Such is the
      manner in which the Platonic Sokrates is made to deal with
      Euthyphron, and in which the real Sokrates deals with
      Mel&ecirc;tus:<a name="FnAnchorv1_11_50" href="#Footnotev1_11_50"><span

      the administering of a logical or dialectical lesson. When we come
      to the Treatise De Legibus (where Sokrates does not appear) we
      shall find Plato adopting the dogmatic and sermonising manner of
      the first chapters of the Xenophontic Memorabilia. Here, in the
      Euthyphron and in the Dialogues of Search generally, the Platonic
      Sokrates is something entirely different.<a

        Compare, even in Xenophon, the conversation of Sokrates with
        Kritias and Charikl&ecirc;s &#8212; Memorab. i. 2, 32-38: and his
        cross-examination of the presumptuous youth Glaukon, Plato&#8217;s
        brother (Mem. iii. 7).</p>

        Steinhart (Einleitung, p. 199) agrees with the opinion of
        Schleiermacher and Stallbaum, that the Euthyphron was composed
        and published during the interval between the lodging of the
        indictment and the trial of Sokrates. K. F. Hermann considers it
        as posterior to the death of Sokrates. </p>
      <p>I concur on this point with Hermann. Indeed I have already
        given my opinion, that not one of the Platonic dialogues was
        composed before the death of Sokrates.</p>

   <h4>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note</h4>
   <p>This HTML version was prepared initially for the on-line Grote Project by Ed Brandon from volumes in the Internet Archive. It owes a very great deal (its style sheet) to the Project Gutenberg versions of the 1911 <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> produced by Don Kretz and others. Don provided a revised style for the side-notes to accommodate Grote&rsquo;s predilection for very long notes. (Even so there are a few occasions where the appearance may yet be bad in some browsers because the side-note extends over more lines than its accompanying paragraph. If there are also footnotes in the paragraph I have had to guess at how much blank space should be inserted for the footnote not to overlap the side-note.) I have modified it in one respect to permit Grote&rsquo;s use of italics in some side-notes.</p>
